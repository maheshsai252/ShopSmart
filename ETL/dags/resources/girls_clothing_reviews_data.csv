"These tights are exactly what they are supposed to be.  I've washed them and she's danced in them half a dozen times and they have held up well..no runs or pulls. I do not know how they would be for heavy use (like someone who dances every day) which is why I gave 4 stars instead of 5. My daughter is a size 10 in most clothes and these fit perfectly as long as I stretch them as I'm pulling them up.

My daughter doesn't like these tights because she said they make her legs itch and ""prickle"" when she's dancing and getting hot, but that is my daughter and not the product.  I mention this in case you have a child who has sensitive skin, or suffers from skin rashes like eczema.  They may not like the feel of these as they are not soft like a microfiber.",They do what I want them to do!,4.0,B0002QVAAG

Product arrived quickly.  These were tights for my grand daughter for Easter.  We opened the package on Easter morning and went to put the tights on.  Unfortunately there was a hole in the crotch.

"These tights are all I expected and more.  They are very shiny and pure white.  They are thick just as dance tights should be.  My daughter wore them for Easter and will be using them for her dance show in a few weeks.

"I have bought several pairs of these tights in the past year, and bought a pair of pink and tan to tuck away for my daughter's dance recital.  I have had pairs that washed and held up well through many washings, and a few that I had to toss after a few times because they got a run very quickly.  I just pulled out a brand new pair yesterday for dress rehearsal.  The pink pair ripped RIGHT OUT OF THE PACKAGE.  The manufacturing of these tights are inconsistent.

You definitely get what you pay for and knowing the fabic is holding strong gives me comfort that the sun isn't getting through to my daughters sensitive skin.

"I bought this brand / style of tights for my daughter when she started dance class at 3 years old. Back then, she wore the Toddler size. I love these tights so much that every time she outgrows a pair, I simply buy the same brand / style in the next bigger size. She's gone through sizes Toddler, Small, and Intermediate, and we're now on Medium. The sizes seem to run true-to-size. My daughter is currently a size 8, and the Medium (8-10) fits perfectly.

These tights are super soft and stretchy, and my daughter has been able to put them on all by herself since she was 6 years old, wearing size Intermediate (6X/7). (Back then, she had trouble putting on ""regular"" tights by herself, I guess because they're usually not as stretchy.)

None of my daughter's tights have ever ripped. I think the Toddler or the Small got a small ""blemish"" (a little discoloration, and the material felt thinner in that area) from when my daughter fell on her knee, but it never opened up into a run or a hole. Her current tights do have a couple snags in them around the knees, but again, they haven't opened up into runs or holes. Overall, I am very satisfied with the quality.

As an aside, I'll mention that one year, when I hadn't bought these tights yet, the salesperson who sold us ballet shoes talked me into buying Capezio 100% Nylon tights. (I think the store only carried Capezio brand tights.) After a few weeks of classes, both my daughter and I found we didn't really like them, compared to the Danskin UltraSoft Microfiber tights. They weren't very stretchy, so they were difficult to put on, and within a couple weeks, they had several snags. I quickly switched back to our trusted brand and style.

"For now, I am giving this product 3 stars.

My main issue is the sizing. I have are 5 and 6 yr old in baton twirling and they needed suntan stockings. I ordered a S(4-5) and an intermediate (6X-7). Can you tell which one is which in the picture? If you guessed the shorter one is the 4-5 and the longer one is the 6X-7, you guessed wrong. Luckily I can have my eldest wear the 4-5 and vice versa.

The other reason is the color. While they are both suntan, the one on the right is clearly darker while the one on the left looks more like a beige.

As for the material, the 6X-7 looks very tiny for my 5 yr old but the quality SEEMS good and it stretches so she fits into it.

This may just be a fluke but I would recommend buying this product 1-2 weeks in advance due to sizing.

As for SIZE.  I have been dancing since the age of 6 and after retiring as a professional dancer, opened my own school.  Parents
too often make the mistake of buying dancewear TOO SMALL because they don't understand how it is worn and its purpose.
In the case of tights, I ALWAYS buy UP in size.  And when looking at sizing charts pay more attention to height than weight.

"I bought these tights for my 5 yo daughter for her dance recital. Even though it says 4 - 7, these tights were to small for my 5 yo. Meanwhile I should say that my daughter is 46 in. tall, which is pretty tall for her age, but still 7 is a quite an exaggeration. I ended up buying the bigger size and giving the ones I bought to a smaller classmate of my daughter. And they were really happy with the quality of the tights. They survived several dress rehearsals and recital as well.
So I would recommend these tights.","Danskin Girls 2-6x Fishnet Tight,Black,S/I (4-7)",4.0,B000ENT6PS

"**Updated**
I had really high hopes for this suit set based on other reviews.  My kids are very pale and I love to have them covered up, so instead of buying several cheap bathing suits, they got one ""great quality"" more expensive one.  We got the blue and the shorts have faded drastically in color, while the top has not.  The flowered side fabrics have thinned and stretched, becoming almost see-through and seem as if this suit has been worn for years and handed down through several siblings rather than being a few months old and worn by one kid.

**Update, I have contacted Tuga by email and they have gone above and beyond to take care of my problem.  I changed my review from 2 stars to 4 because it is really hard to find a company so committed to making its customers happy these days.

I suspected it would be a bit big and it was around the chest and waist. I tied it tighter with bow in back and it was fine. My daughter is above average height, so it worked out. If you have small 5 year old get a size 4. I think this would fit any 6 year old. This could be used for flower girl, child baptism, or 1st communion. Could also be used as a costume for pretending to be a bride, just add veil. Just be careful of color choices. white is true white. The dresses are solid all one color. Some of the color photos are not correct colors in real life.",This is a good dress for the price  NOTE- pink is ALL pink  a light pastel pink photo not correct,4.0,B000HPLUIE

"Bought these dresses one size larger than the kids usually wear for length as they are both tall for their age..Worked out really well because the sash tightens the waist to fit great and make the skirt even fuller.

"The dress is cute. Kind of thin and a little cheap, but not terrible. If you're looking for high quality, this isn't it. It's good for a one-time wear for a flower girl role. You may also need crinoline underneath because it doesn't poof like it could. The netting is longer than the underskirt and I don't think it's supposed to be.

"*On Bro-in-Law account* I'm really happy I decided to take a chance on this dress. My daughter is going to be a flower girl, the wedding is 3 weeks away. The dress I originally ordered came in the wrong color and so I went on the hunt for another dress because they were out of the one I ordered in white. I started searching and had like 7 dresses in my cart when I started narrowing down, this dress looked the most like the dress the bride had originally picked out. It seriously got here 6 days earlier than it was supposed to, it came with a bonus headband, and it's so cute. I don't think it looks cheap at all. The only thing I would say is that I wish it was a little fuller, but for the price you can't beat it! Also it fits true to size.","Super Cute dress, AMAZING price!",5.0,B000HPLUIE

"I ordered two of these for my daughters who will be flowers girls in couple of months.  Thanks to others' reviews, I ordered correct sizes.  Size 2 fit my almost 3 year old who wears 3 clothes.  The length is perfect, the waist is still big, but workable.  Size 8 fit my chunky 7 year old.  Length is perfect, the waist is roomy, but workable as well.  I'm happy with the purchase.  It's very cute.  Bride is happy with my choice and my daughters love the look.  Older one said it's bit itchy around the waist.  I'll find a long cammi or a high waisted shorts for them to wear underneath, but that wouldn't be a problem with such a roomy fit.  A word of caution- I snagged the fabric in the back right away the first time I undid the buttons on both dresses.  Something on the buttons catch.  I was annoyed.

"I have previously bought this Hanes underwear, in Hipster size 2-3. My 3.5 daughter, who is thin (with an ""athletic rear"") is swimming in brief underwear. So I tried the hipsters. They were pretty decent. They stayed in place, not too much fabric, decently comfortable, etc. So now that they are getting a hint small, we tried size 4. Please see the pictures below:

1) The turquoise underwear are Hanes Bikini in size 4 along with the package of assorted colors I received
2) The Bikini size 4, over the yellow Hanes Hipsters in size 4. You can see the cut difference between the Bikini and the Hipster.
3) The white underwear is the Hanes Hipster in a size 2-3 - so you can see the difference between the size 2-3 and size 4 underneath. Also when you compare photos, you can see that the Hipster size 2-3 is similar in cut to the Bikini size 4. The main difference is that the waist on the Bikini size 4 is bigger than the Hipster size 2-3. But other than that they are cut pretty similarly.

I was also worried that the Bikini style would not be ""appropriate"" for a 3.5 year old.  However, it looks totally appropriate.  Everything is modestly covered and the sides are not too small.  Moreover, because she is thin, the bikini just fits her body better without the excess material.

Colors: I received an assortment with a turquoise theme.  No pinks, purples, reds, etc.  So be aware that you may get a color scheme that your daughter doesn't like, and if so, be prepared to return it.  Luckily my daughter liked the turquoise theme.

To sum up: My thin/skinny daughter is in between the Hipster size 2-3 and size 4. And because of it, the Bikini size 4 fits her much better. Is this expensive, beautiful underwear? Nope. But is this decent material, with a decent cut, with no tags, that doesn't ride up, and that will last a year? Yup. And at basically $1 per underwear, it is perfectly priced for what it is. I hope this is helpful to you!

UPDATE: so I am not sure if my daughter had a growth spurt in 3 weeks, but all of a sudden these underwear aren't quite big enough.  They are wide enough, but as I mentioned before, she has an ""athletic rear"" and they when she moves around a lot sometimes they move down a bit.  So, here are my updated thoughts: if your daughter is thin with an ""athletic rear"", get the hipsters.  But if she has a flatter rear, then get these.  :)","Comparing the Hanes ""hipster"" and ""bikini"" little girls underwear",5.0,B000J429LU

"I purchased this dress for my 7 year old daughter for her first communion this year.  She LOVES it!!!  It was delivered extremely quickly by this seller even though I don't think it qualified for Amazon Prime.  Excellent dress for the price.  Material is nice and comfortable.  It does not look cheap!  I love that it is somewhat understated without too many ""bells and whistles"".  We will probably leave the flowers pin off--it does seem to make it a bit gaudy/cheap looking for us, but, that is a personal preference for us.  We find that most of these dresses come with some ""fluff"" of some sort no matter the price point.

I would also mention that it was so nice to find this in a size 6!  My daughter is very tiny for her age and the size 6 was difficult to come by.  Her biggest request was that her dress be floor length and this one is!  I was worried it might be too long for her, but, it should be perfect.  Her shoes have a tiny bit of heel, so, I'm thinking this dress will look just right!

My daughter is pleased as punch!!!",We are loving this dress!,5.0,B000MC1NWK

It fits nice and has enough room in case she grows a bit before her big day, but isn't too big where we have to make adjustments. Very happy with this purchase.

"This dress is so beautiful!  It is not your typical communion dress, which is what we wanted - it is very sophisticated and does not have that ""too much like a wedding dress"" look.  That being said my daughter wore this dress for the first time at church last Tuesday night for her class picture for her communion....she had it on less than an hour, in that time, the silk flower fell off of the pin it was attached to and came completely apart (yes the flower is missing in her picture) my daughter was so embarrassed  and upset she thought her dress was ruined but I used hot glue gun on all the layers of the flower and re attached the flower to the pin.  The beautiful band around the waist is coming apart and falling off the dress....yes, it is unraveling and the pearls are starting to fall off. I do know that I paid less than $50 for the dress, but Amazon had the best price, other websites had the same dress priced at well over $100....needles s to say I am ecstatic I didn't pay a lot  for it....I am sooooooo saddened and disappointed by the quality of this dress although I did purchase this dress a few months ago, it has been hanging in our closet up until last Tuesday night, when she had her pictures taken.

"I gave the product 2 stars because the fit was off and quality wasn't up to my expectations.

Our needs: My daughter needed a white or ivory dress for her stint as a flower girl. She is 4.5 years old, and is petite and slim to regular build. She typically fits 4T We wanted a pretty dress that would be comfortable enough to wear during the wedding/reception but not too expensive considering the one time use.

I purchased several dresses online. The design is very princess like but it did not look very nice on my daughter. I ordered a size 4 having the expectation is would be too large based on the info in the size chart. I purchased this size because the size 4 had free returns while the size 2 did not. The dress fit across her shoulders but was very big in the chest and waist and was too long. Because it was too big, it hit more towards her lower calf and dropped the waist down.  In addition, the quality in the material/sewing was not good around the button holes. Threads were loose so when I undid the buttons, it got caught in the threads. This happened with several buttons.

In the end, I am returning because of the fit and quality. I am not going to order the size 2 because I have another dress that we purchased that looks much better and is within our price range.",Pretty but fits large and issues with buttonholes,2.0,B000PJYLM4

The elastic on the waist before any stretch measures 17 in and the length is 26 inches from the waist down. This looks really nice under her dress and she's got some growing room so I think she'll be able to wear it again. I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 because I was really hoping the skirt had more fullness to it, other than that, very happy with it.

The suit is great. This is the second tuga suit like this I've had for my daughter. My daughter has played all day everyday at the beach this week and no sign of over exposure to the sun. So it does a great job protecting her. But for her it's a bit short in the torso. She just turned 5 and I ordered the size 6-7 based on the size guidelines from the tuga website. I ordered this size up also because I know she's tall for a 5 year old. (The first suit I order for her from tuga I also went up a size and did not regret it) My advice is if your child has a long torso you need to go two sizes up.

"This suit was promising in the beginning.  Seemed to provide good sun protection (no tanning underneath) and had good coverage.  And, it wasn't too heavy.  My daugther didn't seem to mind wearing it in the 95 degree summer days.  However, it proved to be a big disappointment in the end.  I bought a size larger than I needed for my daughter, hoping it would last two seasons since it was pretty expensive for a swimsuit.  Unfortunately, it didn't even last through one.  The material thinned out significantly over the summer leading to a failure in adequate sun protection, as evidenced by the fact that my daughter started tanning in areas covered by the suit.  There were many areas were the material became so thin and worn out, my daughter would have had better protection wearing a nylon stocking.  Also, the suit ripped down one side despite no contact with anything sharp or shear force.  I have had better quality suits for less price in the past.

"Socks are nice, but since the sizing is a bit confusing, here is some help...

These socks are sized in inches, the numbers will be about the length of the child's feet.

Here are some rough guidelines to help you choose the size:

Size 5-6 socks = Size 3 to 7-1/2 shoes = 1 to 2 years

Size 6-7 socks = Size 6 to 11-1/2 shoes = 1-1/2 to 4 years

Size 7-8 socks = Size 9 to 1-1/2 shoes = 3 to 7 years

"I have a little one with sensory issues, and finding socks that don't hurt is quite difficult.

My LO can wear those socks inside out (which is more than I can say about all other ""comfort"" or ""no seam"" socks I've tried). I'm still looking for the perfect cotton no-seam socks (not sure they even exist), but those might very well be the best option out there. Either way, they make for easier mornings...

Note: My LO was between two sizes. I ordered both sizes. The ankles on the smaller sizes were a little tights. So if in doubt, order the larger size.

Tip: Wash/dry the socks inside out if your child wears them outside out (the regular way), and wash/dry the socks outside out if your child wears them inside out (my LO's way). This way, the side that makes contact with the skin will stay smooth and soft. The side you wash on the outside tends to get rough with some hard tiny fuzz balls.",Good for children with sensory issues,4.0,B000Y6AH5I

"I was searching for a petti to go under my daughter's costume for a community theater play. I needed a white one, and came across this on Amazon. I searched the local boutiques and some department stores, and even etsy for some similarly styled slips and petti skirts. But the price was anywhere from 2 to 3 times more expensive, plus shipping. I took mychances and ordered this slip, and it fit the bill!

The shipping was quick, and the skirt fit perfectly, and was just enough fluff to go under her costume. She did alot of dancing, sitting, standing andmoving on stage, and she never complained about stiffness or that it ""itched"". The slip was soft and comfortable, and durable.

"I ordered a few of these for my niece's 12th birthday to go under some of those loose fitting, off-the-shoulder tops I got her at Forever 21.  She wears long sleeves under them in the winter and tanks in the summer.  Forever 21 is an adult store, so their tanks, even size XS, are too low cut for a 12-year-old.  I ordered these tanks in size 10-12, and wish I had gone up a size.  I think they are more size 10 than size 12.  Still, my niece is nice and thin, so I think these will do for the summer.  Then she'll have to get other ones for next summer.  The next size up would have lasted her more than one summer.  I just hope these don't shrink, cause then they definitely won't fit.

"I bought this for my 12 yo daughter to square dance in.  She doesn't like the ""flying saucer"" look.  She is thrilled with the softness of this petticoat.  While it does not stand out like a square dance petticoat - because it isn't one - it is exactly what she wanted, and she loves it.  It arrived promptly and was packaged well, and she wears it to square dance every week.  Thanks for a wonderful product!

Update:  October 25, 2013  My daughter still loves her petticoat!  I have offered several times to buy her a square dance petticoat for special dances, but she is not interested because she is so happy with this petticoat.  She frequently mentions how soft it is.  She wears it at least once a week, sometimes twice, and it is holding up very well.  This is a great product, and I am so glad I found it.",My daughter is thrilled,5.0,B001817FNU

"I was searching for a petti to go under my daughter's costume for a community theater play. I needed a white one, and came across this on Amazon. I searched the local boutiques and some department stores, and even etsy for some similarly styled slips and petti skirts. But the price was anywhere from 2 to 3 times more expensive, plus shipping. I took mychances and ordered this slip, and it fit the bill!

The shipping was quick, and the skirt fit perfectly, and was just enough fluff to go under her costume. She did alot of dancing, sitting, standing andmoving on stage, and she never complained about stiffness or that it ""itched"". The slip was soft and comfortable, and durable. It is still in good condition, and we have used it to go under some of her other outfits. I am very pleased with this purchase!","Cute, great price!",5.0,B001817FNU

"DURABILITY : This shirt has held up very nicely. This was purchased to satisfy the collar requirements of Pre-K. Yep even Pre-K has dress code now. This shirt has fought countless battles against glitter, glue sticks, mud, grass stains, pasta sauce, mustard, markers, and the big daddy of them all, ketchup. With the help of Dreft laundry detergent,  it has won all of those vicious battles and still looks awesome.

THICKNESS: It is a little on the thin side, but given that she wears a cami under it, a dress and blazer over it, it works for her. If she just wore this by itself I might have made her wear a sweater to keep warm.

SIZE: It is true to size. For my little one she was going through the change of life, yep from the toddler section to the little girls section. But she was still had a body part in each section. So I got two in size 4t and three in size 5. Same with the short sleeve version of this shirt.

If you happen to order these and your child cannot squeeze their foot into them, soak the entire boots in hot water and have your child wear them until they dry. When almost dry, apply a hand lotion to the skin of the boots... OR stuff a rag into the toe of the boot and shove a bottled water down the leg of the boots and let them dry that way.

Love the pockets too and the snap up buttons which is so much fun for the child to put on him/herself. I bought the coat one size larger and roll up her sleeves so that we can keep the jacket for another year. The only complaint is that when my daughter puts on the hood, you cannot button the coat all the way to the top (leaving one button unbuttoned).

The hood is nice because there is a bit of a ""brim"" that comes out which will help keep her dry in the rain and the coat comes below her knees. Actually I guess the one slight negative is that the coat is pretty big. My daughter usually takes a 4T or a 4 but because the height max listed for a 4T was 39"", I went with the 4/5. The arms need to be rolled up about three inches on each side but at least I know she'll be set for a while!

It was a bit big for her when we bought it, so I rolled up the sleeves and sent her happily on her way.

"My son is special needs and wears AFO -ankle braces, the kind that cover his whole foot and calf. It's pretty much a boot. I have been looking around everywhere for socks for him to wear with these as his other ones have become all stretched out and some have vanished. These came today 9/24/12. Arrived 4 days earlier than expected. Soon as I took them out of the pack I had to try them on him. He is 12 yr's old with small feet. He's not able to walk. Anyhow, I ordered the medium size 12-6 Shoe, size 8-9. They are a little snug but not to tight, the fitting is just right. I love how it doesn't have any lines running through the calf area of the sock and the part at the top with the nice fitting elastic. Other socks I have checked out all have lines running through, or are to thick and leave marks up and down his legs. These aren't made that way. I will definitely purchase more of these socks for him. I am glad I kept looking and came across these. If you have a special needs child that wears AFO's, (even if your child is a boy) try these out, they are good and you can't even tell they are girly :) Thank you Jefferies for a perfect AFO sock!

"I purchased these socks for my two yr old son to wear under his AFO (ankle foot orthotic) braces (my son has cerebral palsy). I struggled to find cotton, seamless, non ""ribbed"" socks that were long enough to cover his legs under his braces (up to just below his knee). Even local department stores don't carry neutral colored, cotton, smooth knee socks! I know these are listed as ""girl socks"" but they are plain white, smooth socks with no frills/designs that would make them ""girly"" or ""ribbing"" that would make them inappropriate for wearing under AFO braces. My son has worn them almost every day since I bought them several months ago, and they have held up wonderfully. No wearing thin, no holes, no shrinking, nothing! I don't have a single complaint! I only wish they were available in a variety of neutral colors. I am now ordering more, a size larger, as my son is (of course) growing!

"I just received two pairs of these jeans, one in white, one in dark crystal today. Was a bit disappointed because they are not made of 100% cotton like the description shows.

It's lame that they are supposed to be from one product line but have different quality, length, and of course, not true to the description.

I have gotten tights from everywhere. I bought some from Target recently too. None compare to Bloch. Bloch tights can handle a lot of wear. They will stain before they wear out. The only reason I buy new ones is because my daughter does stain them by playing on the floors too much at the dance studio. Otherwise they stay in great condition and they wash like new. These tights are excellent quality. They are true to size and they hug the legs the way tights should. Tights should not have baggy areas. Since my girl started dancing I have become somewhat of a fan of Bloch apparel. They are the only brand of ballet slippers I buy.,Bloch forever,5.0,B000ENN3SO

I wish that I had been able to purchase both from the same seller so that I knew that colors would match perfectly, but these tights were an almost perfect match for my leotard.  The size says 2-4T.  I think it's more true to size for 2-3T.

"I bought a size 7 for my almost 7 yr old who usually wears a size 6/7 dress and a size 10 for my tall 9 yr old.  The younger daughter tried on her uniform first and it was almost down to her ankles & she swam in it. I initially thought I'd been sent a size 10 in both colours (I got Navy for her and Khaki for the older daughter). I had the 9 yr old try on the size 7 and it fit her perfectly.  Someone commented that it was stiff and I do agree but the quality is good and she's wearing leggings & a polo shirt underneath so it doesn't bother her.  Thankfully Amazon has a great return policy so I just had my older daughter keep the size 7 and exchanged her size 10 Khaki for a size 7. I got a French Toast uniform jumper for the 7 yr old.  It's lighter-weight, softer fabric and was true to size (got her a 6X).","Good quality, good price but it's HUGE!!",4.0,B000QIXWXS

I bought this for my 2 month old in preparation for a beach vacation. The 3-6 month size fits well with plenty of room for her to grow into it and use it the rest of this year. If your child is especially chunky I would recommend sizing up.  The fabric and stitching all seem like high quality. She was very comfortable when we tried it out at the pool. She had her tuga suit on and a sun hat and did not even get close to pink while we were out in the sun. I am very pleased with this purchase.,Baby is ready for the beach,5.0,B000ROJCKI
"Great fit. I have a stockier 2 year old and a lengthier 3 (almost 4) year old. This suit fit them both very well. I ordered the 2/3 and the 4/5. The mid-section was a tad snugger and the arms/legs a tad longer on the 2 year old. The suit fit great on the 3 year old, giving both girls room to grow as they get leaner and taller. The torso on these suits is a bit short compared to the arms/legs being a bit long in general, but this worked great for my kids. These should fit great next year as well, so that helps make up for the higher price.",Great fit.,5.0,B000ROJCKI

"This rash guard swimsuit fits well, is very cute, and is great for covering your little one's skin from the sun. However, I am giving it only 3 stars because there is some type of defect in the fabric. After the 3rd or 4th time that my daughter used it, some type of mold developed all over the legs. It looked like sand stain, but she had only worn it once in the sand. I called Tuga Customer Support and they were very nice and accommodating and sent me a replacement suit. That suit held up for another 7 or 8 uses in the pool, but as soon as she wore it on the beach, it developed the same dirty, moldy appearance in the legs. We have followed the care instructions for both suits - we hand washed the suit after ever use, wrung it out well, and let it air dry.

"Orange was my daughters favorite color last year and she wanted a new bike. My parents wanted me to order this bike so they will have a nice Xmas gift for her. My father assembled this bike and when we got home my little one started to use it in the house right away, and we realize that there is a problem with turning right or left because the bike was very stiff. The steering handles would not turn . We applied more oil and loosened the screws a little to make it turn. It did not help and in the spring we thought when she starts use it , it would work. But it did not and she fell off the bike many times because she could not steer. It is very dangerous for her and I must purchase another bike for her. I would never buy this brand again. If I knew I could make return on amazon I would do it right away, but I did not know. My mistake. I do not recommend this bike..",Not very Happy with this bike.,1.0,B000ZJWT2I
"One of the bolts for a training wheel was stripped, but luckily we had something that would fit. The chain was really tight on there, but we loosened it to make it slightly easier to pedal. It is a little tough on the first pedal, but once the kid starts going it's just fine.

"Bought two of these for my 4 year old twins.  They went together easily, looked okay (well, as okay as green and orange can), etc.  But, one of them wasn't able to pedal.  Turns out, the pedal was sticking at the top (i.e. when you need it to carry over, since you have no leverage on the pedal).  Then the other one started doing it.  This was the day they got them.  I took the bearings out, repacked them with synthetic grease (much slicker), and put back together, only left it a little looser.  WOrked okay for another 5 minutes.  Then the same thing kept happening.  The pedals also are very sticky, and don't rotate well.  This might be all well and fine for an older kid who is stronger, but just doesn't work with young kids trying to learn how to ride.  To make it worse, they have both become very frustrated with trying to learn to pedal (tricycles are no problem, they ""get"" the concept).  If I can't find a place to get new bearings for the cranks, I'll probably get rid of them.

Basically, for the price, I expected a functional bike that probably wouldn't really hold out too well.  That's fine, they are learner's bikes - training wheels, and all.  Two years, and that was all I expected.  They aren't even functional.","NOT appropriate for beginners.  Bought two, both have same problem",1.0,B000ZJWT2I

"The picture of the bike on line and on the outside of the box looks great.
However, once we started putting it together we found out that the quality had something to be desired.  Part of the frame was bent, there were spots where paint was missing on the handlebars.

Nothing was poked through the cardboard it was wrapped in so it was that way when it was put into the box.

I'm trying to determine if it pulls the bottoms down a tiny bit too low for my taste. If there is one issue I have with two-piece suits for my tween it's the bottoms. Most are too skimpy for her age and I'm still in pursuit of the ""perfect""  age appropriate suit. This one is almost there. A size up in the bottoms could do the trick but not sure about the top.

"I bought two pairs for both my daughters (4 & 7 years old). They fell in love with their boots instantly, as the design is very cute and they are comfortable to wear. The opening is quite wide which makes it easy for little ones to pull them on and off but also allows lots of puddle water to soak socks. The fairy's wings didn't really make it past the first few times of wear.

What really annoys me, though, is the fact that after wearing them on about ten occasions, the soles of my little one's boots are getting very thin and will surely rip soon, and her sister's boots already both have holes in the heels and instantly fill with water on a rainy day. These boots only make sense if you live in an area where it doesn't rain too often!",Quality quite bad,2.0,B001CMFY4C

The boots are very well constructed and my granddaughter is going to flip out come Christmas day.  She loves ""tinker bell"" and she loves wearing boots.  She is two.  I venture to say she will never take them off.  Back to the boots.  They have a very solid rubber sole that is good for support, sealed tightly, so I would assume no leaking.  This has been my best find yet this Christmas season.  I will do business with this vendor over and over again.

"This dress is gorgeous but it is very costume like. Look carefully at the picture. The dress looks solid and full. Once I received the dress, however, I realized that it is made of a lot of tool and feels more like a dress up costume than an actual dress. The product was not as deep a red as pictured here. Here, it appears to be a vibrant, deep, candy apple red. In actuality, it is more of a red you would see on a cereal box.

The dress is not as pretty as the picture. It is not something I would recommend for a flower girl or any other formal occasion but it would be great for a child who likes to play dress up.

The seller did deliver sooner than expected and, while I did not like the dress, I would buy from this seller again.

This dress looks stunning on my baby girl. I bought it for her first birthday and as an Easter dress since the two events were so close together. The material is so soft and elegant. The stuff that makes it poofy is rather rough but there's a layer of soft material between it so it doesn't scratch baby's legs. Overall a very nice outfit to put your girl in.

"My daughter, who is very particular about comfort in dresswear, loved wearing this dress. It did not itch, pinch, or become in any way uncomfortable. We got through the theater, a long car ride, dinner, and a 30-minute wait in line for Santa without a single complaint. The dress didn't wrinkle and looked as good in pictures at the end of the long day as it had at the beginning. All for a very economical price. I'm very pleased with this purchase.

UPDATE: This dress held up beautifully when washed at home on delicate in my HE machine. I put it in the dryer, too. No problems.

UPDATE 4/23/2013: Over a year later, I have washed this dress many times. Pluck it out of the dryer warm, place on a hanger, and it is wrinkle-free! No pilling. Seams are intact. Dress has been passed down to younger sister. Looks fabulous.

I haven't washed it once, heeding the directions to allow it to sit in the sun for a day once a week.

This swimsuit and skirt are absolutely precious and perfect for my daughter's Luau themed Birthday Party. My daughter wears a 2t right now but I decided to order a size up in the suit. I am glad that I did because it fits her perfectly. The 2t would have been too small. The band around the skit is elastic so there is some give in it but it is pretty snug. Great Price point too.

This rain coat was absolutely adorable.  We paid $59 for it & was a Santa gift that we were extremely disappointed with!!!!! The bottom snap was shipped to us broken.  Our daughter liked it too much to return it but I don't want to pay this price for a broken item!,Disappointed,1.0,B001P7BHPE
"I ordered this raincoat for my 6 year old Granddaughter. The one shown is what I ordered; but, they sent a different one. The one sent is shorter, not as long, and I think may run a little smaller. It's cute, and good quality, but we were expecting this one. We paid $56.05......so; was hoping to get what we ordered. No explanation from the seller when I wrote! But, like I said it is good quality !",Hello Kitty Raincoat,4.0,B001P7BHPE
"I bought 2 of these raincoats for my twin daughers.  The hello kitty on the right-hand side is actually a pocket, which is a nice little detail.  Also, there is a bow on the hood to add personality and character.  The colors are vibrant and the pink cotton lining on the inside of the jacket is soft and of nice quality.  My only complaint is that the jacket seems large.  My daughters are 26 months and the jacket is essentially like a dress on them.  But it is not too long where it is unwearable, so we kept them and my girls love the jackets.  We also get a lot of compliments on them when we are out and about.","Nice quality, a little on the large size",4.0,B001P7BHPE

"this dress was for my daughter to wear to my sister's wedding. She loved the color and it looked great to her on the screen. As it turned out the quality was HORRIBLE! I thought about returning it but didn't have any time to replace it. So she wore it anyways. The bottom itchy rough lacey stuff irritated her skin as soon as she tried it on and so before actually wearing it, my husband removed it from the dress. It was really pointless being there. Also it snagged really easily and has a small hole at the side seam for no apparent reason. Poor quality and not worth the money spent AT ALL! Don't buy it. It truly is prettier on screen then in person. On a positive note, it is true to size and fit her great- the straps did not fall down while wearing it. That is about all I have to say positive about it.",prettier on the screen...,2.0,B001PKUV0I
"Overall, the product is acceptable.  The quality of the sewing is average - the seams seemed to pucker a little, which I guess is expected with the type of fabric.

My biggest complaint is that it's cut on the smaller side of being the true size ordered.  It fit my daughter, but barely.  A bit shorter than I would have liked, and not as loose and flowing.

The pink is more of a dusty rose than pictured, but that worked fine for us.

I'd order Ruby Rox products again, but I'd order up a size, and only buy them on sale, or if I had a gift certificate.",Ruby Rox Diamond Drape Emma Dress,3.0,B001PKUV0I

Update: I got the size 12's today, and they are still way too tight, and they don't seem to be any bigger in size than the 10's. Instead they seem to be longer, and have a larger crotch area.

Daughter is thrilled with them and after washing and getting them to shrink down a bit they fit much better.  She wears a size 5-1/2 narrow shoe so keep that in mind when purchasing.

But they are soft and fit well and don't slouch around the ankles. I've washed them a few times and they are holding up well, which I expect from Hanes.

"It was February of 2011, and in our area First Communion Dresses were extremely limited and very expensive.  So, I took a chance and ordered this dress.  It arrived safely packed to prevent shipping damage.  The dress was not the least bit crushed in shipping.  It was a perfect fit except for the length.  I altered the hem myself as I have extensive sewing experience. No other child in the communion class was wearing this dress.  It was the perfect dress for my granddaughter.

"I ordered 6 pairs of these panties in August. My daughter has only worn them a 3-4 times, therefore, they have only been washed a few times. Each time they come out of the washer, more and more of the waistband has unraveled. You know how sometimes elastic starts to unravel and then there's a huge string that comes off the from the top? That's what happened with these - every time I wash them the top layer of the elastic waistband unravels and is wrapped around other clothing in that load. After their washed a couple more time, there won't be any waistband left!  I contacted the seller and explained that my daughter doesn't wear them often and I've only washed them a few times...that's why there was a delay in contacting them.
