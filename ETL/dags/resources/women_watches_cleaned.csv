5 ounces","Timex Group B.V. is one of the best-known American watch companies. Timex's U.S. headquarters are located in Middlebury Connecticut and it has substantial operations in China, the Philippines and India and full scale sales companies in Canada, the UK, France and Mexico.
The company began in 1854 as Waterbury Clock in Connecticut's Naugatuck Valley, known during the nineteenth century as the ""Switzerland of America."" Sister company Waterbury Watch manufactured the first inexpensive mechanical pocket watch in 1880. During World War I, Waterbury began making wristwatches, which had only just become popular, and in 1933 it made history by creating the first Mickey Mouse clock under license from Walt Disney, with Mickey's hands pointing the time.
During World War II, Waterbury renamed itself U.S. Time Company. In 1950 the company introduced a wristwatch called the Timex. Over the next three decades, Timex was sold through a series of advertisements which emphasized its durability by putting the watch through ""torture tests,"" such as falling over the Grand Coulee Dam or being strapped to the propeller of an outboard motor, with the slogan ""It takes a licking and keeps on ticking."" With the help of former Olympic broadcaster, spokesman John Cameron Swayze, sales took off. The company later became Timex Corporation, then Timex Group and, to date, has sold over one billion watches.
The company has remained very competitive and the Timex brand continues its dominance through present day. Its primary market remains the United States and Canada, although the Timex brand is sold worldwide due to its ability to capitalize on its strong brand image and reputation for quality.
One of the most successful and important features available on many Timex watches is the Indiglo backlight system. Indiglo is a brand name of Indiglo Corporation, solely owned by Timex for licensing purposes. Timex electroluminescent lamps, branded Indiglo, were introduced in 1992 in the Ironman watch line. They were an immediate success. The Indiglo lamp uniformly lights the surface of the Timexs watch dials in a manner that makes the dial read very easily in many different light settings. In some newer watches the Indiglo backlight only lights up the numbers, rather than the entire LCD display, which is achieved by means of a specialized film that inverts the LCD transmissivity.
Today, Timex Group products are manufactured in the Far East and in Switzerland often based on technology that continues to be developed in the United States and in Germany. With a large and varied line of watches, Timex has the style for everyone. From the locker room to the board room, there is a great Timex style time-piece for you.",B00006I5YC,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31MpUA8mLjL._SR38,50_.jpg']",['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31MpUA8mLjL.jpg'],Women Watches

An iconic Italian fashion trendsetter, the House of Gucci--better known just as Gucci--is renowned for its tradition of luxury and constant quest and attention for style and quality. It was founded in 1921 by Guccio Gucci when he opened a leather goods company and small luggage store in his home of Florence, Italy. Within a few years, the Gucci label attracted a sophisticated international clientele who sought out its equestrian-inspired collection of bags, trunks, gloves, shoes, and belts. By the 1960s, Gucci products became icons when worn by such fashion icons as Jackie Kennedy (who carried a shoulder bag that today takes her name, Jackie O), Liz Taylor and Grace Kelly. Artistically combining the elegance of Italian design with the precision of Swiss horological craftsmanship, every Gucci timepiece represents watchmaking at its finest. From inception to finish piece, Gucci demands a commitment of the highest standards, attention to detail and exacting quality control. Today's Gucci watches are made of the most durable materials, while design is focused on modernity--tweaking classic watch styles with contemporary lines and flourishes in order to make a mark of this time for years to come.",B00009W9MJ,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/21f2ivYTDfL._SR38,50_.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/417JtrQJNxL._SR38,50_.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31MpUA8mLjL._SR38,50_.jpg']","['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/21f2ivYTDfL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/417JtrQJNxL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31MpUA8mLjL.jpg']",Women Watches

The Skagen Collection of watches reflects the Jorsts' creative Danish spirit with clean, elegant designs, skillful craftsmanship and technical perfection. When you purchase a piece from the Skagen Collection, you become part of an international community of Skagen owners who believe in a philosophy of design and manufacturing excellence.  Skagen Trend Spotting In the market place, time never stands still and so our innovation never sits idle.

We are never content to follow established trends. We stay true to our classic design philosophy and interpret trends accordingly. We observe, listen and innovate - all to create lasting design pieces. The Result The production of such lasting design pieces often demands special processes and tooling. These are often a challenge to create; however, we are never satisfied with ""close enough"". We continually push and fine-tune designs to stay true to our standards.

Maintaining Your Skagen Watch
All Skagen watches operate with standard batteries. When necessary, any jeweler can replace them for you. Different models are water resistant to varying degrees. Please refer to the back of your watch for the water resistant rating.
Cleaning Your Skagen Watch Skagen suggests the following solutions for cleaning metal and crystal surfaces:
These suggested solutions will evaporate cleanly from metal and glass surfaces. Soap will leave residue behind when dry.
To clean the case and crystal: Moisten a soft cloth with one of the above solutions. Gently wipe the case and crystal clean. Be careful not to put too much stress on the crystal as you clean. *NEVER immerse or soak the case/crystal portion of the watch, regardless of water resistance rating. Moisture could seep past the seals over time.
To clean the band or strap: Skagen soft mesh bands are easily adjustable. Simply insert a small screwdriver or similar tool into the clasp. Lift up the clasp without applying pressure to the thin pin across the clasp and move to desired position. Snap closed securely. Make sure the clasp is set in one of the indentations on the back of the band. Link bands are completely adjustable anywhere watches are serviced.",B0000C9ZCJ,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31MpUA8mLjL._SR38,50_.jpg']",['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31MpUA8mLjL.jpg'],Women Watches

Warranty The Lois Hill International Limited Warranty guarantees your watch for two (2) years from date of purchase under the following conditions: any defect or flaw that is determined by Lois Hill technical staff to be the result of a manufacturing fault will be repaired or replaced by Lois Hill free of charge.
Care & Maintenance of Your Sterling Silver Watch Band  The band of your Lois Hill watch is sterling silver and should be polished periodically with a polishing cloth. It is important not to use any dips or creams when cleaning your band, as the patina of the oxidation will be lost.

1.68 pounds","This timepiece by Tissot for women offers a stainless steel case and two tone stainless steel band. This beautiful watch also features a scratch-resistant sapphire crystal, a precise Self winding automatic movement, and a water resistance level of up to 30 meters (99 feet).

For more than 150 years, Tissot has embodied the innovation and tradition of Swiss watch-making. Based in the Neuchâtel area of the Jura Mountains, in Le Locle, Switzerland, Charles-Félicien Tissot and his son Charles-Emile created the watch making company Tissot in 1853. Whether in the technology of its movements, in the research for special materials or in the very functions of the watch itself, Tissot's engineers and watchmakers have developed pioneering timepieces over the years.
Some of Tissot's triumphs over the years include the the Idea 2001 (the world's first plastic watch) released in 1971, the Rock watch (which set the timepiece's movement in a stone case made from Swiss Alps granite) in 1985, and the Wood watch from 1988 (with a completely wooden case). Tissot uses the best movements (from ETA SA Manufacture Horlogère Suisse), the highest quality materials (316L steel, 18K gold, titanium) and scratch-proof glasses (sapphire crystal--at least 2500 Vickers).
The company has been involved with high profile sports events since 1974 when they sponsored a racing car in the 24 Hours of Le Mans, France. Since then Tissot's timepieces have been chosen as official timekeepers for world championships in cycling, motorcycling, fencing and ice hockey. And Tissot is currently the the official watch and timekeeper of NASCAR.
Tissot timepieces have been worn by a bevy of celebrities over the years--including Grace Kelly, Elvis Presley and Nelson Mandela--and James Stewart's character L.B. Jefferies wore a Tissot timepiece in Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window."" Today the company is represented in a variety of sporting fields by English soccer star Michael Owen, IndyCar driver Danica Patrick, and MotoGP world champion Nicky Hayden. Today, Tissot is a member of the Swatch Group, the world's largest watch producer and distributor.",B00026WAFU,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31MpUA8mLjL._SR38,50_.jpg']",['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31MpUA8mLjL.jpg'],Women Watches

1.5 pounds","In 1976, m. Raymond weil, who had previously been a watch designer for another company, founded the watch house that bears his name in geneva, switzerland. The 1970s, when quartz watches shook the foundations of the mechanical watches market, is remembered as a hard time by all watch companies. It was a common belief by some consumers that there was no need for them anymore; after all, quartz watches were more accurate, did not need winding, and were infinitely cheaper to produce. These were hard times enough that it is a surprise to some that the industry survived as well as it did  it is even more surprising to learn that for raymond weil, these dark days were the hour of its birth. As one of the newer swiss watch houses, raymond weil has built up a prestigious reputation in a short period of time. Quality speaks for itself, and raymond weils watches were so fine, word quickly spread. The number of dealerships then increased with the founder becoming highly sought after and much in demand. Raymond weil produced watches characterized by elegance and simplicity. His watches bring together a subtle blend of trend and tradition. Their exquisite line, beautiful materials and meticulous finishing appeal to people of all tastes. Both chic and practical, raymond weil watches are suitable for all occasions. Drawing on swiss watch making expertise, raymond weil focuses on creativity and quality in order to offer its clients an impressive diversity of models to match each individual and unique personality. Attention to detail is never compromised with raymond weil. It is one of the last independent brands in the luxury swiss watch industry.

Since its founding by its namesake in 1976, Raymond Weil draws inspiration from major musical works to create elegant and cutting-edge timepieces. Named after the Wagner opera, the signature Parsifal collection balances symmetry and harmony with a powerful, valiant outlook befitting of the opera's hero. The Don Giovanni collection, named after Mozart's comedic opera, blends daring design with advanced technical prowess, and the Don Giovanni Cosi Grande mechanical chronograph is hand assembled by Raymond Weil's finest watchmakers. Over the years, Raymond Weil has introduced a number of other series that helped the company become an enigmatic leader of the Swiss watch industry, including the Othello, with its discreet design that emphasizes strength of character and uncompromising beauty, and the sophisticated, color-stained-crystal Traviata.
Based in Geneva, Switzerland, Raymond Weil watches are manufactured entirely in the Swiss watchmaking universe. The company's signature motto--""Independence is a state of mind""--is a reminder of its desire to conceive timepieces that are different, elegant and modern, while at the same time displaying all the rigor of watchmaking excellence.",B0002FQH5K,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31MpUA8mLjL._SR38,50_.jpg']",['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31MpUA8mLjL.jpg'],Women Watches

5 ounces","Timex Group B.V. is one of the best-known American watch companies. Timex's U.S. headquarters are located in Middlebury Connecticut and it has substantial operations in China, the Philippines and India and full scale sales companies in Canada, the UK, France and Mexico.
The company began in 1854 as Waterbury Clock in Connecticut's Naugatuck Valley, known during the nineteenth century as the ""Switzerland of America."" Sister company Waterbury Watch manufactured the first inexpensive mechanical pocket watch in 1880. During World War I, Waterbury began making wristwatches, which had only just become popular, and in 1933 it made history by creating the first Mickey Mouse clock under license from Walt Disney, with Mickey's hands pointing the time.
During World War II, Waterbury renamed itself U.S. Time Company. In 1950 the company introduced a wristwatch called the Timex. Over the next three decades, Timex was sold through a series of advertisements which emphasized its durability by putting the watch through ""torture tests,"" such as falling over the Grand Coulee Dam or being strapped to the propeller of an outboard motor, with the slogan ""It takes a licking and keeps on ticking."" With the help of former Olympic broadcaster, spokesman John Cameron Swayze, sales took off. The company later became Timex Corporation, then Timex Group and, to date, has sold over one billion watches.
The company has remained very competitive and the Timex brand continues its dominance through present day. Its primary market remains the United States and Canada, although the Timex brand is sold worldwide due to its ability to capitalize on its strong brand image and reputation for quality.
One of the most successful and important features available on many Timex watches is the Indiglo backlight system. Indiglo is a brand name of Indiglo Corporation, solely owned by Timex for licensing purposes. Timex electroluminescent lamps, branded Indiglo, were introduced in 1992 in the Ironman watch line. They were an immediate success. The Indiglo lamp uniformly lights the surface of the Timexs watch dials in a manner that makes the dial read very easily in many different light settings. In some newer watches the Indiglo backlight only lights up the numbers, rather than the entire LCD display, which is achieved by means of a specialized film that inverts the LCD transmissivity.
Today, Timex Group products are manufactured in the Far East and in Switzerland often based on technology that continues to be developed in the United States and in Germany. With a large and varied line of watches, Timex has the style for everyone. From the locker room to the board room, there is a great Timex style time-piece for you.",B00006I5YC,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31MpUA8mLjL._SR38,50_.jpg']",['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31MpUA8mLjL.jpg'],Women Watches

An iconic Italian fashion trendsetter, the House of Gucci--better known just as Gucci--is renowned for its tradition of luxury and constant quest and attention for style and quality. It was founded in 1921 by Guccio Gucci when he opened a leather goods company and small luggage store in his home of Florence, Italy. Within a few years, the Gucci label attracted a sophisticated international clientele who sought out its equestrian-inspired collection of bags, trunks, gloves, shoes, and belts. By the 1960s, Gucci products became icons when worn by such fashion icons as Jackie Kennedy (who carried a shoulder bag that today takes her name, Jackie O), Liz Taylor and Grace Kelly. Artistically combining the elegance of Italian design with the precision of Swiss horological craftsmanship, every Gucci timepiece represents watchmaking at its finest. From inception to finish piece, Gucci demands a commitment of the highest standards, attention to detail and exacting quality control. Today's Gucci watches are made of the most durable materials, while design is focused on modernity--tweaking classic watch styles with contemporary lines and flourishes in order to make a mark of this time for years to come.",B00009W9MJ,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/21f2ivYTDfL._SR38,50_.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/417JtrQJNxL._SR38,50_.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31MpUA8mLjL._SR38,50_.jpg']","['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/21f2ivYTDfL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/417JtrQJNxL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31MpUA8mLjL.jpg']",Women Watches

The History of Skagen Designs In 1987, Henrik and Charlotte Jorst came to the United States from their native Denmark to follow a dream: that of owning and running their own business. Skagen Designs was founded by these two natives of Copenhagen on the principle that beautifully designed, high-quality objects can be created at reasonable prices. The Skagen Collection of watches reflects the Jorsts' creative Danish spirit with clean, elegant designs, skillful craftsmanship and technical perfection. When you purchase a piece from the Skagen Collection, you become part of an international community of Skagen owners who believe in a philosophy of design and manufacturing excellence.  Skagen Trend Spotting In the market place, time never stands still and so our innovation never sits idle. Our design team is on the pulse of current fashions, with regular visits to design centers of the world including Denmark, Switzerland,Italy, France, New York and Hong Kong. We are never content to follow established trends. We stay true to our classic design philosophy and interpret trends accordingly. We observe, listen and innovate - all to create lasting design pieces. The Result The production of such lasting design pieces often demands special processes and tooling. These are often a challenge to create; however, we are never satisfied with ""close enough"". We continually push and fine-tune designs to stay true to our standards. We know what we want and are not satisfied until the design, material and workmanship are all just right. The result of such hard work and dedication speak for themselves in the jaw dropping enthusiasm and excitement created whenever anyone views our product line.
Maintaining Your Skagen Watch
All Skagen watches operate with standard batteries. When necessary, any jeweler can replace them for you. Different models are water resistant to varying degrees. Please refer to the back of your watch for the water resistant rating.
Cleaning Your Skagen Watch Skagen suggests the following solutions for cleaning metal and crystal surfaces:
These suggested solutions will evaporate cleanly from metal and glass surfaces. Soap will leave residue behind when dry.
To clean the case and crystal: Moisten a soft cloth with one of the above solutions. Gently wipe the case and crystal clean. Be careful not to put too much stress on the crystal as you clean. *NEVER immerse or soak the case/crystal portion of the watch, regardless of water resistance rating. Moisture could seep past the seals over time.
To clean the band or strap: Skagen soft mesh bands are easily adjustable. Simply insert a small screwdriver or similar tool into the clasp. Lift up the clasp without applying pressure to the thin pin across the clasp and move to desired position. Snap closed securely. Make sure the clasp is set in one of the indentations on the back of the band. Link bands are completely adjustable anywhere watches are serviced.",B0000C9ZCJ,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31MpUA8mLjL._SR38,50_.jpg']",['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31MpUA8mLjL.jpg'],Women Watches

The History of Skagen Designs In 1987, Henrik and Charlotte Jorst came to the United States from their native Denmark to follow a dream: that of owning and running their own business. Skagen Designs was founded by these two natives of Copenhagen on the principle that beautifully designed, high-quality objects can be created at reasonable prices. The Skagen Collection of watches reflects the Jorsts' creative Danish spirit with clean, elegant designs, skillful craftsmanship and technical perfection. When you purchase a piece from the Skagen Collection, you become part of an international community of Skagen owners who believe in a philosophy of design and manufacturing excellence.  Skagen Trend Spotting In the market place, time never stands still and so our innovation never sits idle. Our design team is on the pulse of current fashions, with regular visits to design centers of the world including Denmark, Switzerland,Italy, France, New York and Hong Kong. We are never content to follow established trends. We stay true to our classic design philosophy and interpret trends accordingly. We observe, listen and innovate - all to create lasting design pieces. The Result The production of such lasting design pieces often demands special processes and tooling. These are often a challenge to create; however, we are never satisfied with ""close enough"". We continually push and fine-tune designs to stay true to our standards. We know what we want and are not satisfied until the design, material and workmanship are all just right. The result of such hard work and dedication speak for themselves in the jaw dropping enthusiasm and excitement created whenever anyone views our product line.
Maintaining Your Skagen Watch
All Skagen watches operate with standard batteries. When necessary, any jeweler can replace them for you. Different models are water resistant to varying degrees. Please refer to the back of your watch for the water resistant rating.
Cleaning Your Skagen Watch Skagen suggests the following solutions for cleaning metal and crystal surfaces:
These suggested solutions will evaporate cleanly from metal and glass surfaces. Soap will leave residue behind when dry.
To clean the case and crystal: Moisten a soft cloth with one of the above solutions. Gently wipe the case and crystal clean. Be careful not to put too much stress on the crystal as you clean. *NEVER immerse or soak the case/crystal portion of the watch, regardless of water resistance rating. Moisture could seep past the seals over time.
To clean the band or strap: Skagen soft mesh bands are easily adjustable. Simply insert a small screwdriver or similar tool into the clasp. Lift up the clasp without applying pressure to the thin pin across the clasp and move to desired position. Snap closed securely. Make sure the clasp is set in one of the indentations on the back of the band. Link bands are completely adjustable anywhere watches are serviced.",B0000C9ZC4,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31MpUA8mLjL._SR38,50_.jpg']",['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31MpUA8mLjL.jpg'],Women Watches
Lois Hill Women's Swiss Quartz Stainless Steel and Sterling Silver Dress Watch(Model: 9385-9121-09),"Precise Swiss-Quartz movement
Mineral crystal
Case diameter: 25 mm
Stainless-steel case; Teal dial
Water resistant to 99 feet (30 M): withstands rain and splashes of water, but not showering or submersion","Blending Asian and old English design, this watch is highlighted by a unique, hand-crafted sterling silver link-style bracelet band. The watch also features a small, square sterling silver bezel, stainless steel housing, and shimmery teal dial background. The watch's bezel is polished sterling silver and the center of its dial is decorated with a swooping vine pattern. It also features a subsidiary dial above the 30-minute mark that shows running seconds.
The sterling silver bracelet band is composed of H-shaped sections of paisley-like filigree patterns with granulated accents set against a black background. They're joined together by small squares filled with a silver cut-out pattern. The interior of the band is smooth against the skin. The band is joined together by a stainless steel butterfly clasp that's easy to release and swing open or snap back into place.
Special features and dimensions:  Swiss made watch, hand-crafted band. 3 ATM water resistance rating (safe to 30 meters, can withstand gentle splashes but is not suitable for swimming). Luminous hands glow in the dark. Watch dimensions: 1.1 inches (including winder) wide, 1.3 inches long Band width: 0.69 inches Battery can be replaced by professional jeweler. Average battery life is approximately 18 months, but will vary according to environmental conditions.  The industry standard for jewelry, sterling silver is composed of 92.5% silver and 7.5% copper (which helps to toughen the silver). Stainless steel is an extremely durable metal alloy that's virtually immune to rust, discoloration, and corrosion.
Lois Hill's signature of fusing and reinventing the ancient into contemporary and timeless pieces of art are transformed into an amazing timepiece that is much more than jewelry--it's reflective of your personality and sense of style. It can be worn alone as a simple statement, or as the finishing touch to complete any look.
Warranty The Lois Hill International Limited Warranty guarantees your watch for two (2) years from date of purchase under the following conditions: any defect or flaw that is determined by Lois Hill technical staff to be the result of a manufacturing fault will be repaired or replaced by Lois Hill free of charge.
Care & Maintenance of Your Sterling Silver Watch Band  The band of your Lois Hill watch is sterling silver and should be polished periodically with a polishing cloth. It is important not to use any dips or creams when cleaning your band, as the patina of the oxidation will be lost. The bracelet may be cleaned from general daily wear with a mixture of mild soap and warm water on a soft brush or soft cloth.",B0000CA101,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31MpUA8mLjL._SR38,50_.jpg']",['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31MpUA8mLjL.jpg'],Women Watches

Casio
With the launch of its first watch in November 1974, Casio entered the wristwatch market at a time when the watch industry had just discovered digital technology. As a company with cutting-edge electronic technology developed for pocket calculators, Casio entered this field confident that it could develop timepieces that would lead the market.
Today, Casio is focusing its efforts on solar-powered radio-controlled watches: the built-in solar battery eliminates the nuisance of replacing batteries, atomic timekeeping means the users never have to reset the time. Recently, Casio launched a series of Bluetooth watches that sync to the users cell phone to automatically update the time. Casio is always moving time forward.",B0000TIJ6S,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31MpUA8mLjL._SR38,50_.jpg']",['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31MpUA8mLjL.jpg'],Women Watches

For more than 150 years, Tissot has embodied the innovation and tradition of Swiss watch-making. Based in the Neuchâtel area of the Jura Mountains, in Le Locle, Switzerland, Charles-Félicien Tissot and his son Charles-Emile created the watch making company Tissot in 1853. Whether in the technology of its movements, in the research for special materials or in the very functions of the watch itself, Tissot's engineers and watchmakers have developed pioneering timepieces over the years.
Some of Tissot's triumphs over the years include the the Idea 2001 (the world's first plastic watch) released in 1971, the Rock watch (which set the timepiece's movement in a stone case made from Swiss Alps granite) in 1985, and the Wood watch from 1988 (with a completely wooden case). Tissot uses the best movements (from ETA SA Manufacture Horlogère Suisse), the highest quality materials (316L steel, 18K gold, titanium) and scratch-proof glasses (sapphire crystal--at least 2500 Vickers).
The company has been involved with high profile sports events since 1974 when they sponsored a racing car in the 24 Hours of Le Mans, France. Since then Tissot's timepieces have been chosen as official timekeepers for world championships in cycling, motorcycling, fencing and ice hockey. And Tissot is currently the the official watch and timekeeper of NASCAR.
Tissot timepieces have been worn by a bevy of celebrities over the years--including Grace Kelly, Elvis Presley and Nelson Mandela--and James Stewart's character L.B. Jefferies wore a Tissot timepiece in Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window."" Today the company is represented in a variety of sporting fields by English soccer star Michael Owen, IndyCar driver Danica Patrick, and MotoGP world champion Nicky Hayden. Today, Tissot is a member of the Swatch Group, the world's largest watch producer and distributor.",B00026WAFU,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31MpUA8mLjL._SR38,50_.jpg']",['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31MpUA8mLjL.jpg'],Women Watches

The art of the craft. Inside an Invicta Workshop

1.5 pounds","In 1976, m. Raymond weil, who had previously been a watch designer for another company, founded the watch house that bears his name in geneva, switzerland. The 1970s, when quartz watches shook the foundations of the mechanical watches market, is remembered as a hard time by all watch companies. It was a common belief by some consumers that there was no need for them anymore; after all, quartz watches were more accurate, did not need winding, and were infinitely cheaper to produce. These were hard times enough that it is a surprise to some that the industry survived as well as it did  it is even more surprising to learn that for raymond weil, these dark days were the hour of its birth. As one of the newer swiss watch houses, raymond weil has built up a prestigious reputation in a short period of time. Quality speaks for itself, and raymond weils watches were so fine, word quickly spread. The number of dealerships then increased with the founder becoming highly sought after and much in demand. Raymond weil produced watches characterized by elegance and simplicity. His watches bring together a subtle blend of trend and tradition. Their exquisite line, beautiful materials and meticulous finishing appeal to people of all tastes. Both chic and practical, raymond weil watches are suitable for all occasions. Drawing on swiss watch making expertise, raymond weil focuses on creativity and quality in order to offer its clients an impressive diversity of models to match each individual and unique personality. Attention to detail is never compromised with raymond weil. It is one of the last independent brands in the luxury swiss watch industry.

Since its founding by its namesake in 1976, Raymond Weil draws inspiration from major musical works to create elegant and cutting-edge timepieces. Named after the Wagner opera, the signature Parsifal collection balances symmetry and harmony with a powerful, valiant outlook befitting of the opera's hero. The Don Giovanni collection, named after Mozart's comedic opera, blends daring design with advanced technical prowess, and the Don Giovanni Cosi Grande mechanical chronograph is hand assembled by Raymond Weil's finest watchmakers. Over the years, Raymond Weil has introduced a number of other series that helped the company become an enigmatic leader of the Swiss watch industry, including the Othello, with its discreet design that emphasizes strength of character and uncompromising beauty, and the sophisticated, color-stained-crystal Traviata.
Based in Geneva, Switzerland, Raymond Weil watches are manufactured entirely in the Swiss watchmaking universe. The company's signature motto--""Independence is a state of mind""--is a reminder of its desire to conceive timepieces that are different, elegant and modern, while at the same time displaying all the rigor of watchmaking excellence.",B0002FQH5K,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31MpUA8mLjL._SR38,50_.jpg']",['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31MpUA8mLjL.jpg'],Women Watches

Casio
With the launch of its first watch in November 1974, Casio entered the wristwatch market at a time when the watch industry had just discovered digital technology. As a company with cutting-edge electronic technology developed for pocket calculators, Casio entered this field confident that it could develop timepieces that would lead the market.
Today, Casio is focusing its efforts on solar-powered radio-controlled watches: the built-in solar battery eliminates the nuisance of replacing batteries, atomic timekeeping means the users never have to reset the time.

About Skagen Named after a fishing hamlet in Denmark on the northern tip of the Jutland peninsula, Skagen Designs was founded by Henrik and Charlotte Jorst in 1991 after the two Copenhagen natives moved to New York City. The company subscribes to the principle that beautifully designed, high-quality objects can be created at reasonable prices. Skagen watches represent the technical excellence, refined design and operational simplicity that have created the unique reputation of Danish design.
The fishing village of Skagen--the Skaw--lies where the northern-most tip of the Danish peninsula known as Jutland bends East and breaks the surging waters of the Kattegat and Skagerak seas. The spectacular natural beauty of the area is compellingly beautiful, and its white sandy beaches have been visited by artists for centuries.",B0002UD438,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/21xf1hhHZ8L._SR38,50_.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31AkT9UGjcL._SR38,50_.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31MpUA8mLjL._SR38,50_.jpg']","['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/21xf1hhHZ8L.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31AkT9UGjcL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31MpUA8mLjL.jpg']",Women Watches

Movado
The art of Movado is the art of design. Since its founding in 1881 by 19-year old entrepreneur Achille Ditesheim in the village of La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland, Movado has achieved a legacy of design innovation, earning more than 100 patents and 200 international awards for artistry and innovation in watch design and time technology.
Movado, meaning ""always in motion"" in the international language of Esperanto, is the hallmark of some of the most famous timepieces ever created: the 1912 Polyplan, its revolutionary, patented movement constructed on three planes to fit a case curved to follow the wrist…the WWI Soldier’s Watch with its elegant, protective grill…the 1927 Ermeto, a capsule-shaped pocket watch wound by the sliding motion of its case…the innovative 1950’s Kingmatic series of rotor-driven automatics…the Movado Artist’s Series by luminaries of the fine art world…and the Movado Museum® Watch with its legendary dial.
Defined by a single dot at 12 representing the sun at high noon, the Museum Watch dial is regarded as an icon of Modernism. It was designed by Bauhaus-influenced artist Nathan George Horwitt in 1947. When Horwitt’s dial was selected for the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1960, it was the first watch dial ever awarded this distinction. The name ""Museum Watch"" derives from this recognition. Today, Movado watches are in prominent museums worldwide, and this legendary dial distinguishes an entire collection of singular timepieces.
The Movado Boutiques extend the Movado brand philosophy of design innovation beyond watches to a range of products for modern living. Exclusive offerings include the proprietary and patented 114-facet Movado Diamond™ jewelry collection, Movado’s own modern 18K gold, diamond, sterling silver and gemstone jewelry, signature pens and personal accessories, Movado clocks and fine Swiss watches. Selections are highlighted in our seasonal catalogs. There are currently more than 25 upscale Movado Boutique stores in major markets across the United States.
Excellence in design. A dedication to Swiss craftsmanship. The quest for technological innovation. The Movado philosophy remains as valid as it was in 1881. Swiss made and water resistant, all Movado watches are distinguished by a legacy of design innovation and dedication to the future of time.

Pulsar by Seiko Holdings Corporation.  A spectacular breakthrough  Pulsar was born in an age of optimism. In the 1970's, everything seemed achievable through the rapidly growing technological expertise at the world's fingertips. Space flight had been converted from dream to reality, computer science was developing at break neck speed and electronics seemed to deliver new advances every day. Pulsar symbolized the age. It was new and it was bold, it was surprising and it was different. Pulsar, the world's first electronic digital watch, created a sensation when it was unveiled in New York in 1972 and it changed the world's perception of time.  A tradition of difference When the brand was taken into the Seiko Corporation in 1980, it brought further surprises to the world; the first calculator watch in 1980 and the first all-quartz watch line in 1981 were among its industry-leading achievements. And throughout the '80's and 90's Pulsar continued to bring to market new products that were born to be different. The Avant-garde collection in 1980's set a new style in women's watches and Spoon in 1990's were unique designs which further cemented Pulsar's image as an ingenious and surprising watchmaker.  Towards a modernist future Today, Pulsar remains loyal to its heritage. It was born to be different and it will remain so. Each Pulsar watch has the hint of the futurism and modernity that have always been its hallmark. Pulsar is a brand for the individual who appreciates real value and seeks quality with individuality and flair.",B000792JTY,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41tsZP5CSbL._SR38,50_.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31MpUA8mLjL._SR38,50_.jpg']","['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41tsZP5CSbL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31MpUA8mLjL.jpg']",Women Watches
