"The shorts looked as though they were well made, but I don't even know if they fit. I bought them for my grandson but he wouldn't even try them on, let alone wear them to school.",too 'dorkie' for my grandson,4.0,B0002UD48S
"Khakis come in all shades, but this one was a little too greenish-tinged to be wearable as school uniform. It was also a little bit tighter around the waist and did not ""give"" as much as the Classroom Brand of the exact same size. Very nice-looking and well-made shorts, just not the right color, which does not show up on the computer screen. So while I love the shorts, we ultimately cannot use them.","A Little on the ""Greenish"" Side",5.0,B0002UD48S
Dickies brand are great uniform shorts/pants that really hold up to rough and tough little boys.  These are well constructed and a great value.  I find this brand to run a little small.  My son usually wears a regular size 8 in Old Navy and other brands (not their husky) but he needed a 8 husky in this brand.  I find these hold up better and are more comfortable than much higher cost brands.,Great Value!,5.0,B0002UD48S

These shorts are great quality.  I bought the long pants last year so I knew what to expect.  The only kind of odd thing about the pants is they aren't the light khaki of most uniform pants.

"I love the adjustable waistband.  My son is tall and thin so the 3T will fit him for a while.  I really like that I can buy wranglers for my baby boys, they are great, durable, long lasting jeans that always fit well.  And they can match dad in their cowboy pants.  The only thing I didn't like about the purchase was that they are a little expensive for such a small pair of pants, you can buy adult mens wranglers for only a few dollars more then these size 3T's.","great jeans, a little spendy",4.0,B0008JFA9O
"I ordered these on Amazon because I found out at the last minute that my son needed black pants for his play as his part changed to that of the penguin, lol!  I didn't have time to run out to target to buy a pair, which is where I normally get all his jeans.

The jeans arrived and I threw them in the washing machine on the light agitation/cold water setting so that my son could wear them on the following day for the play.

The button fell off in the wash!  I know that 5 year old boys can be hard on jeans, so I don't set the bar too high for endurance, but falling apart before he has even worn them is a new low!

Great jeans. If you have rough tough boys that tear up their jeans in no time then you want to buy these. These jeans are not thin jeans. These are thick denim material that can hold up to some wear.

"My grandson is in the 75th percentile in height and 25th percentile in weight. I purchased these jeans because the come in 1T slim. Most of his pants get too short and never do fit in the waist. He is currently in 12 month length, but his pants are 3"" too big in the waist. I purchase these wranglers because they should come closer to fitting, right? Not even close. They are bigger all over than 12 month pants (except the length) - they are same in hips and waist, but 1"" shorter than his 18 month levis. The waist on the Wrangler 1Tslim is 19"" - which doesn't look too great on a 15"" waist. So if you have a slender guy that needs pants, this isn't it. Gave 2 stars for general quality. They would be nice pants for somebody else - I need to update this review! Over the last month, my daughter has mentioned a few times that this pair of jeans is her absolute favorite for my grandson. He has been growing like a weed for the last several months and this is the only pants he has that are not way too big in his waist at the same time the length is perfect for him!","when we waited till he grew a little, these pants are perfect length and width!",2.0,B0008JFA9O

"My son is 4, 38lbs, and 41"" tall, so I consider him slim.  I ordered him a 2/3T, which fit him PERFECT.  So if your little man is slim/avg, I would suggest one size down then they wear in pants for the perfect fit, or reg size to grow a bit.

My ONLY complaint is the elastic waistband.  My son has been potty trained for 2 1/2 years, but when he rushes out of the bathroom, the waistband tends to stay a tad rolled (don't ask how he accomplishes this, LOL).

It has not been easy to find underwear that fits him, NONE of the character boxers fit him, too saggy in the backside:(  He says he prefers the ""Fruit of the Loom Boys 2-7 Toddler Assorted Color Boxer Brief 3-Pack"", I also purchased them here on Amazon.",Good stuff,4.0,B000IGC7OI

"I got this wetsuit for my 5.5 yo boy (a very skinny little guy, 46 inches, 37 lbs) because he was shivering within 5 min after he jumped in the pool. I took a smaller size as I read reviews about sizing being a bit off. The XS (3-4 years) fits him perfectly, although probably he won't be able to wear it next year. This was the thickest suit I could find for this age and my son, who was just learning to swim, loved it. He liked the look but also the extra buoyancy it gave him, which boosted his confidence to swim at the deep end. The down side of that was that he loved it so much he never wanted to take it off, even when the pool was 80F, mostly because he was unsure he could swim without it. Finally, he learned that he could. Great wetsuit for little kids!","My son loved it so much, he never wanted to swim without it!",5.0,B000N4QVVA

"Fabulous! For reasons unknown my son starts shivering about 5 minutes after entering our community pool. Others kids seem fine for hours. Mine has chattering teeth and bluish lips in minutes. Decided to get him a wet suit this year and was looking for a few things in particular: high neck to help keep water out, slim fit for his skinny body and good looks. Debated between this and the O'Neill Youth Reactor. The fact that it was $10 cheaper didn't hurt but chose this one because it was 3mm and I knew my son needed all the warmth he could get to make our trips to the pool worth it. It fits like it was designed for him. He's a tall 5 year old 47"" and 47lbs. Bought him a size 7/8 and couldn't be happier. It probably won't fit him next year but I don't think wetsuits should be bought with room to grow. They won't work as efficiently if there's a bunch of loose space to fill with water.
UPDATE 7/18/17: I was wrong. It DID fit him the next year and it still fits him the year after that. My son is now 7 years old and about 52lbs and 52"" tall. He doesn't wear it as much as he used to but I still take it everywhere there might be swimming. Thankfully I had it this past weekend during a hotel stay. He started shivering within 30mins. Dried him off, shoved him in this and I was amazed that it still fit. It honestly probably fits as it's supposed to now and was a little big before. Will be buying the 9/10 for NEXT year.",SO glad I took a chance on this!,5.0,B000N4QVVA

"The material is very nice. Very white and just thick enough where an undershirt isn't necessary. Seems very well made. However, the sizing is very small. My child is 9. Granted, a bigger 9 (tends to wear a size 12), but not big enough to wear husky size clothing. I measured him and decided the 14/16 size, according to the Dickies size chart, would be best. He should have had enough room to add an undershirt, and we hoped to have it all year for his orchestra concerts and possibly next year as well. Sadly, the chart is inaccurate. This shirt barely buttons down the front, and the wrists are very tight when buttoned as well. Thanks to the thickness, he won't need an undershirt. He is insisting on keeping it so we will, but it won't last long given it's size. I highly recommend if your child is on the smaller side.",Runs small,3.0,B000OLCRB0

"I searched on amazon for a flat gray tee shirt so I could make a shirt for my son's 3rd birthday and this shirt looked perfect.

I paid extra money for a shirt matching the color that I wanted and waited extra time for it to arrive. I was so disappointed that it was heather gray after all. I didn't realize that the shirt colors were just photoshopped on to the same little girl with a mullet. If you click through though, you can easily see that. I am not even sure if I want to take it up with amazon because the color is correct (I checked other sites that show Hanes light steel color and it is basically heather gray), it is just not as pictured.

He's a near seven year old who wears a size 5 everywhere but here apparently :)  We bought a seven and they are ok in length & chest but the it's the but.  The but is cut tightly.  Only a super flat but would love these overalls but since it's a seven, they fit.  The color is perfect b/c he wanted ""Super Mario"" overalls.  My biggest issue is they only have one button on the side, so they gap and show his underwear near the front pocket.  It's an awful long gap.  I would manufacture them with two buttons.

"I bought several of these Indera Youth Union Suits for my 9 year-old son, and we have been very disappointed.  There are several issues:  1. They run super-small in the body.  He normally wears size 10-12, but neither the 10-12 or the 14-16 in this product fit him properly in the body, and both sizes give him a major wedgie.  2. The stitching is very flimsy and has not survived one gentle wash in cold water.  There are now threads hanging loose everywhere, and the arm seams have separated already, leaving a gaping hole under one arm.  All this without even being worn yet, mind you.  3.  The material is very lightweight, and while that may provide comfort and breathability, it doesn't seem like it is going to survive more than a few washings, and it certainly will not survive any boyish pre-bed gymnastics.  Let me put it this way:  Without even being worn yet, these suits already look as flimsy as my son's Costco pajamas look after a full year of washing, wear and tear, and they cost more.

"The quality is excellent, which is typical for Levi's, and what we expect when ordering. However, this wasn't our first color choice.

Fairly certain this pair was mislabeled, as we have already have these in a different color for my husky, sensory child, and the fit is awesome.

"These are even better in person! The Levi's label and little red tag on the back, all the real pockets, and stitching details are perfection. I have a very sensory little man, and he cannot stand the feel/heaviness of denim/twill, the button fly on regular jeans, or the lack of movement that comes with denim.  He needed something appropriate to wear to school, especially for the winter months when basketball shorts are no longer an option. This pair arrived today, only two days after I ordered! We immediately tried them on.  Little man is in love, his Momma is a happy camper, and we can't wait to get the other pair in black. THANK YOU LEVI'S, for making options that special needs kids will embrace. We'll have long term Levi's loyalty for this. NOTE: my boy runs on the husky side, and these size 8 pants are plenty big in the waist, hip, and thigh with room to grow. The drawstring more than compensates for this in our case.

There is flexibility in the sizing.  The inner waist includes customizable elastic bands to ensure your toddler's comfort, regardless of waist size.  This is perfect for us who have toddlers that grow upward first, and then fill in later.

"I've owned several pairs of these jeans through many washings and still love them.  They're tight, but not skin-tight.  For the record, the Boy's size 20 measures 30"" X 30.5"" (Hey Levi! How about a chart!) and differ from the adult cut only in the cuff opening which is 1/5"" larger in Boy's.  The touch of spandex makes for a flexible fabric that gives you the range of motion you need if your active.  The best part is not having mounds of material swishing and rubbing against each leg when you walk.

The 9"" rise on these jeans means they sit on your hips like normal jeans.  They don't feel like they're about to fall off, and you've actually got usable pockets!  It's a comfortable fit that's cut right for a slim guy.  They're as fine a pair of skinny jeans as you'll find.",Great fit and NOT too skinny,5.0,B0018SQ6ZG

When I received the shirts, the collar was already unraveling and for some odd reason the button holes were not stiched very well.  Perhaps that is why they have their product marked so cheap because the product is cheap.  In the future I would suggest getting the French Toast brand and not the Genuine brand.

"I LOVE this jacket!! This review is after a year of use, hope it helps you decide! :)

We have matched this with the Nautica Big Boys Oxford dress shirt in blue with a pair of Levi's jeans, and with Sketchers grey leather boots, (English) riding boots, and Oxford dark brown leather shoes.

I'm sure you can probably tell our youngest has had many occasions to wear the jacket. We have had the item for a year actually, and have had it dry cleaned a number of times at this point. All the buttons are still tight (believe me our 8 year old has not been gentle with it either), no loose strings, and actually no signs of wear, and tear at all. The jacket is worth the money, and looks great!

Halfway through the year - having survived the holiday season both at school for the holiday celebrations, and assembly's, and with us at family, and friends get together 's /celebrations - he won Best Dressed at his schools Valentine pageant! (He wore the knee high English riding boots on that occasion)

Unfortunately he is the youngest out of all our sons, so I will be passing it on to a friend I really like (I mean it IS an awesome jacket!), BUT will be buying another when he outgrows this one! It's just that nice!

I do recommend spending the money on this jacket, and I do Hate to waste $ , or  overspend on items I can get for the same quality at a lower price, I also hate having to scramble to find a dress jacket at last minute because one of our sons either forgot to tell us they have a ""school thing"", or because they have ruined another one. So I try to get each one of them a nice dress jacket that will not only fit them for the year, but will also survive being cleaned, worn, thrown about, and possibly last a second, or third boy all while looking brand new! This jacket fits the bill, and is the same quality material, and feel of many of my husbands suits.

This jacket is very, very, very nice, and deserves a 6th star for not being a $100 jacket!",Won Best Dressed at Valentines Fair,5.0,B001CVRNTM

Before I purchased this for $19.99 I read the reviews. As far as quality goes the shirt and tie seem pretty solid. The Nautica logo above the pocket is a nice touch.

I took a chance and bleached it in the washing machine. The stains came out. Also I saw a similar white shirt/tie set at Walmart for $11.00. There was a review suggesting buying from Walmart.

I bought this for my son to wear to my husband and I's wedding and it fit perfectly! The shirt I thought was a bit thin in fabric but it worked out great because it was an outdoor wedding and was somewhat hot that day. The only thing I think that would have made it even better is if the price was a little lower considering my son only wore it once and now he is too big for it.,Perfect!,5.0,B001GDL6PI

"I bought this for my son who will be 1 May 29th and we are getting married June 2nd and this is perfect. The material is thin so he won't overheat and it's just so adorable. I will probably sew the shirt on a plain white onsie to keep it tucked in as the others have said it comes out during the day. I got a larger size just incase, I would rather have it be too big than be too tight. But we love it! Can't wait for June!",Love this,5.0,B001GDL6PI
"This little tux was the hit of my sister's wedding. The other reviews are right, though; the tux runs very small. My son is 4 months old and not quite 15 1/2 pounds. The size 3-6 months was sold out, so we bought the 6-12 months size. I'm glad we did. It fit him really well, and if he was any bigger, the pants would have seemed tight around the waist. He had plenty of room in the shirt and the vest. My only complaint is that the shirt comes untucked. We remedied this by sewing the bottom half of a onesie onto the shirt so we could snap it. This kept us from having to tuck the shirt in continuously. For the price, this is adorable.","Very cute, but runs small",4.0,B001GDL6PI

"I bought this size 8 for my 6 year old son.  The pants length was perfect and since the waist is elastic, it fit as well.  My son is tall and thin so the rest of the outfit did look a bit big on him.  I would have preferred a size 6 with longer pants.  But since I was aware of the length I ordered the larger size and it did the job just fine.  I would suggest to the manufacturer to send the pants without the hemming in the pants and to send them longer so that they can be adjusted for taller or shorter boys.  These pants have no extra material to let out anywhere.  My son will outgrow the pants lengthwise long before he outgrows the shirt and tuxedo jacket.",Great tux for my little boy,5.0,B001GKCUXI

"I'm very impressed with the value of this tux set.  My 2yo son was a ring bearer at a wedding and pretty much stole the show in his outfit.  At 37.5"" he's tall for a just-turned 2yo, but a 2T fit him fine.  The shirt could have been a little longer but it was ok.  A couple of minor quality issues: 1) my son tugged at his bow tie in a practice wear and it disconnected from its neck band - easy enough repair though; and 2) the cummerbund is not sized correctly to make the velcro squares join - we just tied the straps in a knot.  I would recommend a practice wear so that these issues get addressed before the big day.  The pants and jacket have satin trim that are dry clean only.  Overall I loved that everything bar the shoes and socks came with this outfit which reduced my 'work' considerably.  The outfit arrived quickly, packaged in a waterproof bag, and did not require any pressing.  The shirt had reversible button options (black and white, or remove completely to use the clear regular buttons) which I really appreciated.  On the big day, no one could believe the low price of this tux andI would recommend it highly.",Perfect!,5.0,B001GKCUXI

My 16 month old son just wore this tux to a wedding and got MANY MANY compliments on it. Everyone loved the tails on the coat. I really liked that we could choose between formal black buttons on the shirt or the standard buttons. The only complaint is that the cummerbund was way too big. We ended up having to tie it behind his back rather than using the clasp--which was fine since he had the coat on the whole time.,Great tux,5.0,B001GKCUXI

"Ok, my item arrived on time even before then the estimated time :) Ok, so I ordered size 5 my son is size 5 he is 4 years old. I say size 5 because we went to a clothing store and took a suite and tried it on him and the size 5 seem to fit him just perfect I didn't get it because it was black and I was looking for white for a special occasion. 1- The shirt is too big it looks more for like a 5-6 year old and not 4 year old. Thankfully I had purchased a white long sleeves shirt at JC Penny size small and it was just right on him.
2- The pants just a little too big and definitely long so I would take it to the Cleaners to bring up the seam and take them in at least an inch from the waist.
3- The vest, maybe just a tad big but I think its fine beside it goes inside the jacket, and the tie I think its great that it can be adjusted by a zipper :)
4- The Jacket, definitely big big big, wow size 5 is way too big for my son ( he is slim) maybe if he was a bigger 4 year old and chubby perhaps it will fit him but to me this jacket its more suitable for a 5 year old. I should of taken the size 4 but the special occasion is approaching soon and I don't have time to return it, I hope they can help me at the cleaners.
I gave it a 3 stars because its a bargain for the prize and the quality is not bad at all. I went to a tuxedo place to rent a suit for my son and for the one day rental is $179 dollars my husband and I were shocked. I couldn't find the white suit anywhere else so I decided to look in amazon.

"This suit is extremely debonair and dashing...once its altered. Sizing for baby clothes is extremely subjective to that company's definition but by no one's definitions could the pants be considered 3-6 months! At the very smallest they were at least 9-12 months. The jackets sleeves were sized well and the jackets length was good, but the width was so wide that I can only assume it was fitted on an oompa loompa. The stockiness of the jacket did not match at all with the length of the pants.

"I purchased this tuxedo for my grand-nephew for his baptismal.  We had previously purchased a formal suit, but really wanted a tuxedo.  So we browsed amazon.com and found this very good looking tuxedo and it was just his size too.  Find a tuxedo in this small size is often hard to do, but we found one.  So we ordered the tuxedo, which, of course, amazon.com made easy to do.  The tuxedo arrived to my home as scheduled, and when we opened the package, we were drawn back by the way the tuxedo looked.  It was made very professionally and looked awesome.  We  haven't shown my niece the tuxedo yet, as we want it to be a surprise the day of the baptismal.  But it looks great and I can hardly wait to put it on our little Khing.  I will take pictures and will send them for your review once I get them.  I just know our little Khing is going to look great for his baptismal and this is all we wanted.

"This suit is extremely debonair and dashing...once its altered. Sizing for baby clothes is extremely subjective to that company's definition but by no one's definitions could the pants be considered 3-6 months! At the very smallest they were at least 9-12 months. The jackets sleeves were sized well and the jackets length was good, but the width was so wide that I can only assume it was fitted on an oompa loompa. The stockiness of the jacket did not match at all with the length of the pants. But, once the pants were fitted and the jacket just not worn, the suit was quite handsome.",better in picture then in person,3.0,B001HNM016
"I usually do not take the time to write reviews on products, but I don't want the same thing that happened to me to happen to someone else.  I ordered this for my son to wear, he was the ringbearer in my sisters wedding.  I went by their size chart and when it arrived it was way to big on him.  This was not the only problem though.  It was made of very thin material you could see his skin through the pant legs.  I returned it!  I figured I would lose the shipping but at least get the rest of my money back.  I was wrong.  When they refunded my money they didn't refund the full amount I had paid for the tuxedo.  When I contacted them to find out why they said they were charging me a 20% restocking fee, and that it was listed on the website when I purchased it.  I told them there was nowhere on the Amazon site that told me they wouldn't give me a full refund.  I was told that they were sorry and would work on getting me a full refund.  I didn't hear from them so I contacted them again after a couple weeks.  I was told they were still working on it and I would here from them soon.

"I purchased this tuxedo for my grand-nephew for his baptismal.  We had previously purchased a formal suit, but really wanted a tuxedo.  So we browsed amazon.com and found this very good looking tuxedo and it was just his size too.  Find a tuxedo in this small size is often hard to do, but we found one.  So we ordered the tuxedo, which, of course, amazon.com made easy to do.  The tuxedo arrived to my home as scheduled, and when we opened the package, we were drawn back by the way the tuxedo looked.  It was made very professionally and looked awesome.  We  haven't shown my niece the tuxedo yet, as we want it to be a surprise the day of the baptismal.  But it looks great and I can hardly wait to put it on our little Khing.  I will take pictures and will send them for your review once I get them.  I just know our little Khing is going to look great for his baptismal and this is all we wanted.  The purchase was great (great price), the delivery was great (arrived before it was supposed to), and the product was fabulous (from the looks, we got our money's worth on this purchase).

"Bought this for a year end chorus concert for my middle school age boy. He is 13, wears 14 or 16 in tops and bottoms. Size 16 that I bought was fitting kind of snug but he said he was comfortable. 14 would have been probably impossible to button (actually, there are hooks instead of buttons). The length was just right too. He is 54 about 110lb. So I would say size up unless your kid is supper skinny but definitely don't size down.
The material is very nice, feels like wool, expensive looking but I think its polyester blend. Ironed well few wrinkles that packaging caused, nothing major.

"I bought this for my 4yo son.  The fit is great and the material is great.  He has no difficulty zipping it.  The only thing I don't like about the fleece is minor and I knew when I purchased it - It doesn't have a hood.  We've already had days that the AM Bus Stop temperature was 30 degrees, so a hood would have been great.  The days warm up to mid 50s to 60s, so by recess he really doesn't need a hood.  I did find another fleece with a hood, and have that on it's way from Amazon.com.","Fabulous, but could be even better with a hood!",5.0,B000B7MGJU
"I hate giving bad reviews, but I feel it's worse to not tell buyers before they purchase about a potential problem. I have many Columbia brand jackets, clothes, etc. so I thought I'd be safe buying this for my son as a fall jacket. I was very disappointed when it came and I discovered was very short (above the waist) and very wide at the bottom (stuck out several inches to let plenty of cold air in). Really a poor fit. Typically clothes run true to size for him, so I was confused by the terrible cut of this jacket.

"Got this for my son for Christmas and it immediately became his go-to jacket (by his own choosing).  Now no matter what the weather, no matter what the temperature, he wants to wear this fleece - and he's always bummed when we make him wear his heavier coat when it's too cold and/or windy for a fleece.  And this from a boy that generally doesn't give a hoot about what he wears!  He loves the soft wear of the fleece and it looks really handsome & masculine on him.  The full-length zipper and raised collar make this more useful and easier to get on and off than a 1/4 zip fleece.  It's a mid-weight fleece providing good warmth for its weight and it seems well-constructed and has been trouble free after a month and a half of nearly daily use.  My son (7) is a little bit big for his age and we got him the 10/12, it's kind of big on him but still functional & with room to grow - he'll definitely get at least a couple of seasons out of it.  We paid $20 for it at a local department store, and it has proven to be a super purchase.  Sturdy, understated but stylish, really comfy, and most importantly he loves it.

"This is the wetsuit you need if you have a skinny child. This fit my son, who is average height but very skinny, enabling him to stay warm enough in the cold YMCA pool for swimming lessons. Until I got him this suit, he was refusing to take the lessons. This suit is a full 3mm thick, unlike most others I've seen for kids, and is snug-fitting on skinny limbs, really keeping him warm. It was a game-changer for us; my son, who used to cry before swimming lessons because he got so cold, now loves going swimming. The sizing is accurate if your child is average height and on the slim side. This is not a suit for a kid with a bigger build--even if you can manage to get it on, getting it off when wet will be a challenge. The suit is durable and well-made. The stitching held firm through many trips to the YMCA's super-chlorinated water. Rinse after each use and hang to dry to keep the color bright. We're now on our second suit, as he outgrew the first. I definitely recommend it.",Skinny kid? This is the wetsuit they need.,5.0,B000N4QVVA
Purchased for my 4 year old grandson so he could swim in our pool. He gets cold swimming no matter how warm it is. His teeth will start chattering and his lips will turn blue. I was amazed at how much this helps! He can now stay in the pool as long as his cousins. I bought a size 8 because he is tall for his age. I didn't want it to be short in the straddle.

"I was looking forward to getting these Marmot PreCip Kids' Waterproof Rain/Hiking Pants for my grandson to try. Unfortunately, the medium size was sent instead of a large and he could barely squeeze into the pair we got. So my review is going to be based on my observations of the materials and construction of the pants rather than how they functioned out in the snow and rain.

The pants are made of a fine 100% polyester ripstop fabric with a water repellent finish that really does resist water. I poured a little water on one of the legs of the pant and it just rolled off. The pants have taped seams, three rows of stitched elastic at the waist to keep the pants close fitting, a pair of zipped pockets, and each leg has an ankle side zipper to help with boots and such. The quality of manufacturing is evident just looking at the pants. The construction is such that these pants should really do their job of keeping kids dry and warm while they are playing outside or just out in the harsh weather.

I think these pants are well made and should last for several seasons of playing in the snow and rain. Do they make them for adults? I  hope so.",Marmot PreCip Kids' Waterproof Rain/Hiking Pants are really good to keep kids dry in rain and snow,4.0,B000O6Z00U
"Well, I tried these out more thoroughly than I would have expected... I ordered these for my son to grow into, and ended up borrowing them for myself! I am a petite female - 5'5"", 110 pounds wearing a large,  in case you're planning to try them too. But enough about grown up use, let me give you a practical review.

These are very thin, which is actually my favorite part. We mostly use waterproof pants for mild winters in Oregon. I like that these can just slide on top of whatever pants my son is wearing. They take up hardly any space at all when packing. And they wash great.

Yesterday, I wore them outside in pouring rain for two hours. When I came back in, even my waterproof Eddie Bauer coat had absorbed some water. But these pants were dry within 20 minutes and every rain drop just beaded on the surface. If you're looking for waterproof, these are certainly that.",These worked so well against the rain that I borrowed them for myself!,5.0,B000O6Z00U
"These are much lighter than I expected and I think they are more to wear over your pants than to wear as pants alone, though you could probably do that too. (If playing in the snow then you definitely need to wear warm pants underneath these.) The material reminds me of the material used in very light (single layered) windbreakers. We haven't had any rain or snow where we are yet, but I did throw these in the wash and they are water resistant! I took the pants out and ended up splashing water everywhere. All our other clothes absorbed the water but the water just flew off of these pants.

A plus for being able to wear these over pants: this will make it so much easier to come into the house after playing in the snow. I always make my son change into dry pants at the door so he doesn't drip melting snow all over the house. With this your child can just take it right off without having to change.","Light, seems to work",4.0,B000O6Z00U
"These are great water-proof pants for kids. While marketed and made to protect children from rain and other water, they are a must have for cold weather climates, where there is a significant amount of snow. They are great for older children who will refuse to wear ""little kid"" snow pants, even though they still need the protection from the wetness that playing in the snow will bring. These unisex pants have a lot of great features: a comfortable, elastic waist, a couple of zippered pockets, zippers at the bottom of the legs to help them to easily slide on/off over boots, as well as an adjustable snap closure for the cuffs to keep snow and dampness out.

They are super lightweight, but offer great protection. In fact, you can even roll them up into a pretty small package and they will fit easily into a backpack for use when needed. These are also machine washable, and easy care all around. And, most importantly, my grandson really likes them, too. 5 stars.","Stylish & Practical, Kid Approved!",5.0,B000O6Z00U

I thought maybe she would wear them for snow play, but as I mentioned she wears them more often than planned.  We went to the zoo last week (Bronx) and it was pretty chilly (November NY weather).

I only did this review to warn others like myself who may not have realized that the shorts are actually see through in that capacity. The description says 100% poly/tricot lining, and I just figured that meant they had an opaque lining on the inside.  They are good quality, and I like the fact that the inseam is not super long, because although  my son is skinny, he wants a larger size as he prefers loose clothing around his waist, and other xl styles of basketball shorts tend to fall far below his knees. For that reason, I do wish that they had the lining so I could keep them because the fit is fine. I got them for him to use in gym class, but unfortunately I don't think the school would like him wearing see through shorts -nor would I, so i am returning them.  just a ""heads-up"" for people like me who don't realize that they are not lined like the type of shorts you'd find at say, K***'s.",The lining is same as outer shell...,3.0,B000U60N6U

"I am a huge fan of Smartwool and was excited to see them in my son's size.  However, my son wears a size 10 shoe and these socks were definitely large on him. Also, although they say ""light,"" they are in fact quite bulky. As a result, my son's shoes don't actually fit on over these socks. On the up side, they will fit him for a couple years, and will be great in snow boots.

"This is a wonderful suit!  I purchaced it for my son's First Communion, but it would be perfect for other formal events such as weddings, family portraits, etc.  It is high quality (coat is lined) and terrific looking.  It is unusual to find a suit that includes a vest for boys especially at such a terrific low price!  The pants come unhemmed, just like an adult suit, so you can tailor them to the boy's height.  It came with a tie, but not the beautiful yellow tie shown in the photo.  The tie was a black or dark gray and white print.  I felt that the tie looked quite boring with this suit, but I had purchased a beautiful tie seperatly so I wasn't disappointed.  It's difficult to tell from the photos, but the fabric of this particular suit is a black or very dark gray tone on tone stripe.  The stripes make this suit a bit more formal.  It looks more formal than a suit without the stripes, but less formal than a tuxedo.  The suit will be versatile too.  The coat could be worn seperately and the suit could be worn with or without the vest.  The suit arrived in less than a week, too.

"To Whom It May Concern:

 RE: 105-524-8542-5052222

Unfortunately, I am unable to rate your products. I ordered  2 suits size 18 for my twin sons on March 21,2008, I received one suit and it was two small. I called and spoke with Nathan Jacobi on March 31,2008 to let him know that I was returning the one suit that I did receive for a size 20. Per Nathan Jacobi, once I told him that I did not receive the second suit he will make sure that I do not receive the second suit it and I should return the first suit and once that is received Nathan will sent me both suit size 20.

To my surprise I did receive the second suit size 18 on April 1,2008 and I had to return both suits on April 1,2008 and was charged $12.30. UPS expected delivery date was Monday, April 7, 2008 tracking number 1Z010X360330864493.

Now, it is May 2, 2008 and I have not yet received my 2 suits size 20. I am very disappointed with the length of time it takes to receive returned items.

At first I was very excited when I came upon your website, having 2 sons, actually 3 sons and being a spiritually family to see such suits that are of such quality, I just  knew I no longer wanted to buy my son' suits anywhere else.

I would like my order as soon as possible. We have several spiritually events coming up this summer and I would like to receive my order all at once. Please don't misunderstand, I know  at times there can/will be delays. However, this is now a little over a month and my sons are suit less.

I was really looking forward in placing more orders with you.

"I was hesitant about the size, as we have bought the briefs version at the local sports store and there is no real sizing info other than ""youth"" etc.  I already made one mistake buying too small: you have to rip the hard plastic package open and destroy it to get the underwear out, then the store gets mad when you return them.  Why they don't do like other manufacturers/brands and allow you to open the pack so you can at least hold them up to your kid?  They are either afraid of theft, or you having your kid try them on or something...Anyway:

I used the guide on the Shock Doc website and just went by waist size.  It was right on the money, my kids waists fell right in the middle of the range for the size listed and they fit great.  I noted though that my kids have skinny legs, so while the waist and upper thigh area had good compression, the leg portion was a little ""baggy"" on the them.  They like the fit over the briefs version.  They don't feel as restricted when playing baseball.  Being cheap as I am, I'm taking the chance at buying another similar compression short that also has a cup pocket.  They also have a sketchy sizing system, so we will see if my trying to save $5 a pair pays off and just using the cup that came with the Docs.",Kids love them,4.0,B00181J4MU

But the cup sticks out so far it's kind of ..um... not appropriate.  I'll keep them and find a smaller cup.  I feel like the design also makes the cup stick out like that.

"These jeans are of typical Levi's quality, which in my opinion is among the best for jeans anywhere. But what makes Levis my ""go-to"" brand of choice >>for my kids<< is the fact that ONLY Levi's offers standard jean models in fully-sized options in kid sizes.

What I mean by that is that I don't have to rely on some cheapo manufacturer's interpretation of what a ""size 12"" jeans for boys is ... Levi's puts that ACTUAL SIZE on the label in INCHES for both WAIST AND INSEAM which to my knowledge NO OTHER JEAN MAKER does for kid-sized pants.

Yeah, my kids are chubby, I failed as a parent to teach them to exercise sufficiently and eat right, whatever. I just want to buy some effin pants that actually fit them without having to guess at the size. Other standard brands like Lee or Wrangler, and especially ALL of the store brands at stores like Target, Kmart, Walmart, Kohls, etc. only size their kid's pants by ""age range"" and do NOT provide waist or inseam measurement. From one brand to the next, a 'boys size 12' jean can vary by several inches in both waist and inseam. Heck, the generics/store brands aren't even offered in varying inseam lengths for a given waist size, there's no variation except in quality ... from one day to the next, those cheapo brands vary in quality from mediocre to absolute trash.

I'll keep buying Levi's ... in my view it's worth paying more for quality jeans that fit rather than trying to make do with the cheap generics at the discount stores.",Levis are the only brand made to fit all sizes,5.0,B0018SP6GQ

The butt is kind of baggy on him though and the belt causes a big cinched look in the back.  I think he misses the built in elastic adjustments found in little boy pants.  He wears his t-shirts over it so it isn't really visible. He likes the comfort as it has 2% spandex.  But if he grows any taller, I'll have to get a size 18 and the waist will be even bigger.

While labeled super skinny they did seem a bit looser than the ones I tried at the store. On me they fit more like regular skinny jeans rather than super skinny. I figure they are cut slightly different than the adult specific 510 variant. Bascially they're not hugging my legs, a good inches worth of extra material around calf.

While I would have preferred a more snug fit at the price point I can't really complain. They offer a savings of 15 dollars. perhaps more depending on where you're buying from.

"The great thing about Levis (and the reason I buy them for my sons) is that they have three variables: hip, length, and style.  Most jeans will just give you a style and a hip measurement, but Levis give you the length as well.  So, you can buy Husky Slim jeans in a variety of sizes, for example.  Or, what I need, is size 16 slim (ie, hip and length) in regular or slim fits.  The style tells you if the leg fit is tight or baggy etc.

Unfortunately Amazon are not providing all the information that Levis have.  It would be great if they would give the classic 28x28 (size 16 regular), 26x28 (size 16 slim), etc.  Until then, I am reluctant to buy since I don't want to deal with the hassle of returning clothes that don't fit.",Why no waist size listed?,3.0,B0018SUB0C

"Before I bought these pants on the internet I bought the exact same pants in the store and my son loved them. I wanted to get some more, so rather than wasting my time by shopping at the store I decided to buy the ""blue color Levis 511 skinny size 10 pants"" online. When they arrived my son would not wear them because they were the wrong shade of blue...they were much lighter. I took them to a local store to see if they would exchange them and when they scanned the UPC code they came up as a closed out item ( a year ago) that only had and exchange value of $13, not the $22 that I had paid.

This is the 2nd time that I have been burnt regarding the color of clothing so I am going to stop buying clothing on the internet unless they pay for return shipping with a more liberal return time period.",Shade of color wrong,1.0,B0018SUB0C
"The jeans themselves are fine.  What I expected from Levi's, in a comfortable non-stiff denim.

However, they run large and I had to return the ones I ordered and get a smaller size.  We measured my nephew's waist, consulted the size chart, and ordered size 16, which had the 34"" waist he needed.  When they arrived, the product label said 34"", but they actually measured a little over 36"".  He could slide them on and off with the waist fastened and the zipper closed.","Good Jeans, but Husky not sized correctly",4.0,B0018SX7X0

"Since there may be smaller adult guys out there wondering like I was, I'll take a minute to comment.

I am 5'7', 135 lbs, and I have a 30 or 31"" waist (depending on brand).  I also have a proportionately sized ""set of equipment"".  The ""adult"" size cups always seem enormous to me and generally get in the way if I am sitting down.  In the past I have bough an adult cup/jock combo, and a standalone ""teen"" size cup so I can get the right pairing.

Based on the sizing chart I found at the Shock Doctor website, I decided to try this short/cup combo in the ""Boys XL"" size (which is the same thing as the ""Men's XS"", but you can't find those anywhere).  That size short, and ONLY that size, comes packaged with the Teen/Medium cup size (which is blue, by the way).

Long story short, it fits!  It's a tad more snug around the waist than I would prefer, but I can deal with it.  Most of my compression shorts/leggings are pretty tight, so I'm used to that.  The cup is very comfortable and not ridiculously large and doesn't get in the way of sitting.

Here is the sizing chart for all supporters/cups currently posted at Shock Doctor:
Boy's PeeWee/Reg (XXSmall) - 19-20"" - PeeWee/XS Cup (Green)
Boy's PeeWee/Lrg (XSmall) - 20-22"" - PeeWee/XS Cup (Green)
Boy's Youth/Reg (Small) - 22-24"" - Youth/S Cup (Red)
Boy's Youth/Lrg (Medium) - 24-26"" - Youth/S Cup (Red)
Boy's Teen/Reg (Large) - 26-28"" - Youth/S Cup (Red)
Boy's Teen/Lrg (X Large) - 28-30"" - Teen/M Cup (Blue)
Men's X Small - 28-30"" - Teen/M Cup (Blue)
Men's Small - 30-32"" - Adult/L Cup (Black)
Men's Medium - 32-34"" - Adult/L Cup (Black)
Men's Large - 34-36"" - Adult/L Cup (Black)
Men's X Large - 36-39"" - Adult/L Cup (Black)
Men's XX Large - 39-43"" - Adult/L Cup (Black)

"Okay, hopefully the review won't get too confusing. We bought this for our little man for my sister's wedding. He was the ring bearer and looked so cute in it.
Pros: The price. You can't rent one for the price of this and now we own one.
  Black Tux. We used this for Halloween and he was a vampire. It has some multi uses.
  No worries. He's a boy, so he was sliding on the floor, dancing, spilling stuff on it, sweating in it, etc but it was inexpensive
  and ours so we didn't care if he tore it up.
Cons: Fit. Our man boy is tall and skinny. The pants were HUGE in the waist but short in the legs. Built more for a sumo child than
  a bean pole. The jacket was similar. He had plenty of room in the body, but the arms were somewhat short.
  Material. It's no Armani, and the fabric is pretty stiff and coarse. The shirt was super thin and looks like it may fall apart after
  one washing.
  Accessories and Shoes. The tie was fine, somewhat hard to get fitting right. The vest was cute as well. There were no
  shoes, so we had to drop like 20 bucks to buy some to go with it.

All in all, for the money, and function, this thing did the job and saved us some coin for a rental that would have been over $100.

I was correct.

Got my son to try this on for size, and in the process one of the jacket buttons fell off. The ""craftsmanship"" if you can call it that, is quite shoddy indeed.

Now, that said, if the suit had actually fit (too small) I might have been tempted to keep it, because chances are my son was only giong to wear it once, for a wedding, anyway. So if you're in the same boat, and want to take a chance, consider yourself informed of the downside ... oh, and if it doesn't fit -- or falls completely apart on the first try -- remember it's going to cost you about $8-10 to return the thing (to California).",You get what you pay for,2.0,B001GBF9ZI

So, it was a great price for something that kids will grow out of so quickly. There were a few strings that needed to be trimmed from the seams, but that was no problem. The pants fit in the waist, but be warned the pants come unhemmed. I did know this when ordering, but not much hemming needed to be done...I think that if they are coming unhemmed, they could have been a little longer to begin with.",AMAZING,5.0,B001GE15UI
"I purchased this natural textured suit for our 13 yr. old to wear for his Aunts wedding in Mexico this January 9, 2010. Wonderful purchase, just what we needed for the warmer climate. Perfect fit, color, which had to be matched to the other adult Groomsmen. It upheld it's shape and press throughout the day. The delivery was very prompt and overall a very pleasant surprise since the cost was minimal for such a quality made suit. Great buy for the money.",Wedding Day Groomsman,5.0,B001GE15UI

"My sister and I tried to purchase matching suits for a wedding our kids were standing up in.  One was suppose to be a size 5 and one was suppose to be a size 4.  Even though the tags on the suits showed that they should be the same thing (but different sizes) they were completely different.  One was gray while the other looked navy blue with pin stripes.  They should have had size differences but the jackets were exactly the same size.  It was so big on my son that it looked ridiculous and we couldn't even use them for the wedding.  Both suits were very big on the boys and one of the vests had the company's name written all over it.  My sister's suit was poorly stitched and was falling apart.  The pants have to be hemmed and we had to cut off about 5 inches of material on each pair of pants.  Also, there is no adjustable strap for the waist in the pants so we had to sew in elastic and darts.  These suits are not worth the money.",Not So Great,1.0,B001GIDOEO

"This was a very cute suit and our son looked adorable at the wedding we attended. However, we had some problems.

We bought a size 2T suit.  The pants, vest and shirt fit our VERY slim son perfectly. The pants come unhemmed so we had to hem those. The jacket was disproportionately larger than the rest of the pieces and we had to hem the sleeves and would have had to take in the jacket quite a bit if we cared to spend the money doing it (which we didn't). There was also a pucker in the shoulder. We considered returning the suit, but the seller charges a restocking fee.

The zipper tie is cool, but when we put it on him on the day of the event, it fell apart completely, leaving us with the zipper part, and two strips of fabric.  We hastily tried to tuck it all together, but it kept falling apart during the evening.  The zipper on the garment bag it arrives in also fell apart.

I had very bad experience with this tuxedo. First I ordered size 5 based on sizing chart provided. It  was too big. So I did exchange for size 4.  Size 4 was even bigger than size 5. I think it was defective. The top was shorter than size 5 but a lot wider. So I did exchange for size 4T. It was too small.  I sent email to US Fairytales asking to send me one more suit in size 4 but did not get any  response from them.

He has worn this about a dozen times now, and it looks great.  I have had to wash it about half a dozen times, no shrinking, or wrinkling.

"I bought this for my son for the purpose of being in my mother, his grandmother's, wedding. It's a cute suit.

My only real sticking points in the quality of this suit are the pants are not lined and, for all intents and purposes, are not fully opaque in the right light (go with dark undies). The other, small sticking point: The shirt is also thin. You will need a white undershirt if you plan to take your little man out of the jacket/vest.

I think this is an excellent buy for a once or twice wearing. If you're looking for a weekly wear, for church or whatnot, you might want to spend a little more money on something made of better fabric.

"Sweatshirt is a nice green color, and a very basic thin cotton. But is a bit odd in its sizing. The body is strangely short for the length of the arms (arms are really long compared to the body). And the hood is huge, way too big. I just received this today and am going to use it as the base of a Halloween costume. I'll have to modify the hood as it's so big it won't stay on my son's head (way too slouchy). The body of the XS sweatshirt fits him well (a small 5 year old) though is almost too short, while the arms are very long and baggy, and that huge hood!

"I purchased this tuxedo from U.S. Fairytales this summer in two sizes: I returned one but they said they never got it so I didn't get reimbursed.  The second was ruined with the drycleaning so I purchased another one but it never arrived.  I contacted the office many times but with no result.  It's been 4 months now so it is a sure thing that I will never get reimbursed for any of the two suits.  Two days (literally!) before my wedding I had to go to a store and buy another suit for my son.  DO NOT work with these people: they must work out of a basement and have a 1-person office.  No telephone number, no CS....the suit looks nice (although it is only for a one-time wear...the matrerial is ""made in China"" and the color is a lot yellower than in the picture).

Very upset. And a huge waste of money.  My son needed white open bottom sweatpants for a play he was in.  I searched white open bottom sweat pants and got this site.

They were not what the picture showed.  He needed them next day so we had to cut them and make due. So I can't return them.

"We bought this suit for my son's first communion.  The material felt thin, and it was not lined, and the buttons are fabric covered., but overall, I think my son looked sharp.  He wore it at least 6 times between Easter and Christmas, and finally outgrew the pants.  The thing I like most about the suit is that the pants had an elastic back so the size 8 was a perfect fit for my 8 year old.  I did try other suits but we would have had to shorten the pants considerably for him to fit a size 10.  My son is not heavy at all but is not slim either so we struggle to find pants that fit well.  The vest was a nice touch, and he received many compliments on how nice he looked.  The price was awesome, and considering they grow so fast, it was nice to be able to dress him for the special day.

"These jeans are the best that I have found for my tall 3yr old.  I have bought them every year since he was a year old!  They do fade a little in the wash (even on cold delicate) but other than that, we love, love these jeans, he looks like dad in them!  It seems like they don't sell them anymore though, which makes me sad.  Good thing I bought the next 4 sizes on amazon.",fabulous jeans,4.0,B0014JGGP4
