"Super cute. I purchased  these in the pink glow color. It isn't neon pink & it isn't the pink you see in the photo. Its a lavender pink- which is still cute. I have another pair of converse in a 7 and they're too long in the toe. So I ordered a 6.5 and they seem okay. Albeit  I don't think I could have gone down a full-size... I don't know why these are called *seaonal, but the canvas is pretty rough & stuff- while its soft& pliable on my old pair. After I wore them with socks they began to soften up, and these actually have an arch in them. I will wear these a lot, but you will need to break them in a bit.",You probably want to Order these a half size smaller,4.0,B00008ZD31

"I have never bought chucks from on Amazon before and it's difficult to find an 8.5 in them anywhere as it is. So I was thrilled to find these. However, THESE ARE NOT AN 8.5. They are most definitely a 9. And honestly, I don't even believe they are truly Converse. I believe they are KNOCKOFFS. I have had TONS of pairs of Converse. They all have tags sewn onto the inside of the tongue of each shoe and they are fabric tags. The tags on these are some sort of rubber. Never ever had rubber tags before, and I've been buying Converse since high school and I'm now 34. I would have just bought a size 8.

I also think the patent leather isn't very attractive or practical - it's a soccer cleat!  and I think the shiney-ness turned off my 10 year old.","Not a hit with my son, but I'm sure the wide fit had to be more comfy.",3.0,B0009QVFT0

We ordered a size 9, though at the time he was fitting exactly a size 8. They fit a bit big at first, but still worked. He's been wearing them now for four or five months, and they still look new. I was worried that they would be difficult to get on and off, since there's no zipper, but they are very easy. The laces need to be double knotted to stay tied, and even then sometimes come untied, but that is the only issue. He's tested their durability and waterproofing, and they pass with flying colors.

"Almost every day I take my dogs to the open space.  I usually wear my super-comfy Nike tennis shoes, but on rainy days or when the tall wild grass is wet with dew, my shoes, socks, and feet get soaking wet.

So I went on a mission to find some waterproof shoes.  I first tried out a pair of waterproof rain boots.  They were stylish and fully waterproof, but more appropriate for a fashionable day at the office than an hour of walking in uneven terrain.  I found them too uncomfortable for practical use and returned them.

Next I bought a pair of duck boots.  That was probably overkill but that's all I could find at the local store.  They were nicely cushioned and again, waterproof but so heavy and bulky that they aggravated my slipped disk.  I actually pulled a muscle wearing those shoes.  So I stopped wearing them after just a few outings.

When I read about the Merrell Mocs, I was intrigued.  Based on another review here, I ordered a kids size 5 and it fit my womens size 6.5 perfectly.  Even in my thick wool socks.  And the mocs are delightful.  They are super lightweight, well contoured to my feet, easy to slip on and take off, and incredibly comfortable.  AND they're water-resistant.  Not ""waterproof"" but they're enough to keep my feet completely dry when I sludge in the wet grass for an hour.  Plus they look good.  I can see the more muted colors even being nice enough for an office environment.

One very minor thing about these shoes is that the inside arch has this support that I wasn't used to.  It's not uncomfortable in any way, just not what I'm used to.  I do walk funny, so it's possible that others won't even notice this.

I'm tempted to buy another pair just in case something happens to the one I have.  I love these shoes that much!",Fantastic Water-Resistant Shoes & They Fit Women's Sizes,5.0,B000B2HVMW

So now I have to exchange for a size 2 (which we tried on at Nordstroms the other day and was way too large that you could not even make it work with padding!!!)

I really liked these slip on shoes but they run too small. I usually order the kids jungle mocs size 7 because they fit like a women's 8.5 but these fit more like a women's 7.5-8. I had to return the shoes and ordered a pair of the Kids Jungle Mocs 2 because I heard they run bigger. Merrell Jungle Mocs are great shoes and I recommend them to other women and kids but I want to warn customers that the jungle mocs that they manufacture now are not as true to size as the jungle mocs they made years ago.

Her pair from last year was worn every single day and still look great. No problems with them coming apart or losing shape. They are comfortable and are a great alternative to wearing boots to school in the winter, while still working for spring & fall. LOVE LOVE LOVE these shoes.

I wish they were available in wide. The flower stitching is a nice touch and the colors are good.
But they stink!  The lable says they are treated with anti-bacterial chemicals to prevent odor (ironic).  I don't like that and wish it had been disclosed in the description. I don't know if it's the chemicals or just the plastics, but the shoes have a strong chemical odor. They are outside off gassing right now, and I trust the smell will fade, but I don't want my kids breathing whatever it is.

He wore this shoes for at least a year and a half until it does not fit anymore but the shoes still look fine after all the rough play he was doing.

"I have ordered pairs of these infant converse for both my son and my daughter when they were infants. I got so many compliments on them when I took the babies out wearing these shoes. They really made an outfit seem so stylish.

The shoes are a very soft material that will be pleasing to your baby. The soles are soft material, as well.  I found that these shoes are really best for pre walkers or indoor use while walking, otherwise they get really filthy because the material of the soles is white canvas type material that really shows dirt. I have thrown them in the washing machine but they don't get all of the stains out from walking and can look really dirty, which detracts from the look of the shoe. So, I liked them best when I just used them on the babies before they hit the walking stage. I also don't think that the bottom of these shoes grips well enough for a walker. If you want a pair of converse for a walker then I recommend getting the hard rubber soled converse which will not show dirt as much, and which grip the ground well. You can find them here&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CONVERSE-Kids-All-Star-Core-Ox-Tod/dp/B004YF7KBE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CONVERSE Kids' All Star Core Ox Tod</a>

I also feel that these shoes run a bit small so I recommend going the next size up, which will also help you get more use out of them. All in all, they are adorable shoes and the height of baby fashion, and they are comfortable as well. Get a pair and get ready for lots of compliments when your baby wears them!",I get so many compliments but best for pre walkers,5.0,B000BJI5HA

"I wanted to love these shoes. They're sturdy and comfortable, they don't show dirt, and even though they're marketed as ""boys'"" shoes, they looked cute with my daughter's summer outfits. They stood up to repeated soakings in her wading pool and dried out overnight each time.

However:
Even though we received size 8, the shoe fit more like a 7.5 and my daughter outgrew it well before the other Stride Rite size 8 shoes we ordered at the same time.  Also, we chose these shoes because of the toe protection, but on the outer side the gap between the straps left my daughter's littlest toe exposed. Her toe would often stick out completely, so we ended up having to use socks, which defeats the convenience factor of sandals in the first place.

"I initially loved this shoe as I thought it was good quality, comfortable, and had good traction. The upper material is supposedly leather while the sole is man-made material - this is very common and I never have problems with shoes made of such materials myself. After a few weeks of wearing it, however, my toddler's feet stunk like you wouldn't believe. This happens with man-made material shoes that do not let feet breathe, and I have stopped buying them for myself long ago (except Crocs, which are anti-bacterial and anti-odor and so usually last pretty long until they need a wash) and certainly would not buy them for my child. So the stinky feet was a surprise, as this is supposed to have leather AND holes to let my child's feet breathe.

"Stride Rite's Austin athletic shoe is a well made and versatile shoe.

The quality of the leather is nice, and the stitching is strong throughout the shoe. It has a heavy dute sole that should wear well for quite a while, even for an active child.

The shoe itself is heavy, not like an ultra light sneaker (which most kids probably don't wear anyway).

Note - there is little padding on the inside of the shoe, which may or may not make a difference depending on your child's foot.

This shoe comes in W & XW sizes.

Another great thing about this shoe is that it's gender neutral, so a boy or girl could wear it.

I love Stride Rite's quality and versatility in the Austin athletic shoe.

I won't buy this style again, because honestly, I ordered one in every size. With the sales/discounts it was about $13 per pair, and I can easily sell used pairs for this much at the consignment shop.",Stride Rite quality for boys or girls,5.0,B000FIK09S

With no means to tighten it, I had to return it.  I got a different style of shoe for him in the same size and brand (OshKosh), and they fit perfectly.

We ordered size 6 in the Blue Depths color.  His toes didn't come close to reaching the end and there was quite a bit of space around the outside of his foot, even for his slightly wider than normal foot.  In order to cinch the shoe down tight enough, he had to pull the cinch string very far out, which left too much string out visibly.  The velcro didn't come close to being tight enough around the top of his foot.  The fit on these is way off.  My son never has trouble with shoes being too wide and these definitely were both too wide and too long.  We didn't even attempt to send them back for an exchange.

The shipping was fast and the packaging was normal for shoes and well protected. My daughter was excited about the brown and pink coloring and how good they fit. She wore them for two days before our hike to school and to play. She wore them for a first hike for about 2 miles... No complaints. They were comfortable and didn't overheat her feet. One hike she came with her grandpa and he let her go without socks (much to her mother's annoyance lol) but no blisters and that one was a mile and a half (I found out after the hike...now we check before every hike).

"I have had these boots for a week of snowy hikes with the dog and they are great so far. They are actually waterproof which is necessary for winter in western NY. I usually take a women's 7.5 wide but there were no wide women's waterproof boots to be found. Luckily the big boys (youth) size 6 ran wider so I tried them on in a store and then ordered these. I was surprised by how light they feel on my feet and I like the extra support of the mid ankle style, especially with our icy and snowy conditions. There isn't much cushion in the sole but this was an easy fix with the addition of some insoles that I already had. The arch support isn't as much as some people might need but it is enough for my 10-15 miles a week.",Great waterproof hikers for ladies with wide feet,5.0,B000MSH1SY

"Ordered the little kids 9-10 for our son, and the length was right (he's around a size 9) but he couldn't actually fit his foot all the way in because the straps were so thick. He is of average size and weight, but he does have wide feet, so probably a kid with narrower feet would've been fine.

As a side note, I originally ordered the 'slim' version of these (which I think is the 'girl' version, based on the color options) in the same size, and though he didn't like the color, they actually fit his feet! The strap was slightly slimmer, and so he had a bit more room to slide his foot in.",so probably a kid with narrower feet would've been fine. As a side note,2.0,B000O7DVZU

"My son liked these shoes. We took them camping and he wore them for a week straight... hiking, wading, walking, campfires and rough and tumble play. He continued to wear them for the rest of the summer. At some point, one of the elastic toggles broke off and the elastic separated, which annoyed him, but he just knotted it to the right tightness and continued wearing them. Other than that, they held up well. I am fairly sure he will still fit them this upcoming summer, since they ran large, which is a major plus in my book. Overall, I'd recommend these shoes with the caveat to be careful with the toggles and how hard you're pulling on them every time you put the shoes on.",My son liked these shoes,4.0,B000OG3D04

"I bought these for my 9yo who wears between a 4 and 5 depending on the shoe and brand. I bought these in a 5 because his feet are still growing and I wanted them to last more than one summer. His feet were swimming in these. He has another pair of sneakers that are a 5 and they fit perfectly, while he has a pair that are a 4 that fit perfectly as well. I'm not really sure they have any kind of regulation with these boys ""big kid"" shoe sizes. They are so unpredictable. Anyway. These look amazing when you get them, they are clearly well made and I'm sure will be perfect once we get the right size. I returned them today and ordered a size 4.

These shoes are a summer sneaker/sandal, they have mess across the top and elastic laces for tightening. However, when my son tried to tighten them these laces got too long and looked horrible. The laces attach to a velcro spot on the toe so that they aren't loose for tripping, but when you pull on it to make them tighter and connect it to this velcro patch it creates a large loop that sticks up on top of the shoe because the elastic is rather stiff not floppy. My son hated that part. I think if they need to be tightened they are too big. If your son or daughter has narrow feet these are not the best shoe. I posted a pic of what I'm talking about with the laces.",They run big and the laces are weird,3.0,B000OG3D04

"I really wanted to like these shoes. They are cute, the price was good and they arrived quickly. I got them for my daughter to wear in her school's operetta.

Unfortunately, they did not fit. My daughter's feet are pretty small but given she is between sizes at this time, I tried to err on the side of caution and ordered a size up. It was still far too small. Furthermore, the material (leather?) is incredibly stiff so even if they had fit her, I don't know that she would have worn them; they didn't seem like they'd be comfortable.

Finally - and I recognize this may have just been a faulty pair - but there was a gross looking orange-brown stain on the ""tongue"" of one of the shoes. So these shoes were immediately sent back.

"If you are looking for a cozy slipper, this is it.  In my view there are two different kinds of slippers overall: hard soled, and soft soled.  I personally cannot stand hard soles...it feels too much like wearing shoes in the house which we don't do.
So, inside our family prefers the quiet softness of soft soles slippers.  These are so soft and cozy, that they are worn constantly.  Everyone in my family wears them (although we all insist on black, which can cause confusion).  It's like having your foot wrapped in a down jacket.  I saw a couple of negative reviews on here and was compelled to say something.  The negative reviews bemoan their 'lack of durability'.  But - again - these are not in the 'hard sole' category.  If you want the comfort of having a soft sole, then you simply will not have as durable of a slipper as a hard sole (common sense, really)  So it all depends on what you are looking for.  My family loves them.",Very cozy,5.0,B000SKUFXO

I LOVE them. They fit perfectly. With thick socks or thin socks. Im glad I got these in kids size because the shaft is also sorter than the womens boot. The packaging wasn't the greatest, the boots have a weird indention but I think it might come out with time.

"These shoes are so adorable and durable. They've been through a lot with my 3 year old and they are still in great condition. The only problem I've encountered is getting his feet in and out. The little velcro strap at the side of the shoe doesn't allow for the tongue to come completely out so sometimes it's a hassle. Although, my son has chubby feet for a thin kid, so maybe it's just him. I have to push his heel down and this usually causes him to giggle since it's ticklish.

"What parent doesn't like Stride Rite's quality shoes at a good price?

The Landon lace up is well made, with high quality leather and stitching throughout. The sole of the shoe is a semi-flexible rubberish material.

I like the Landon particularly because the sole is much more flexible than
the suede dress shoes Stride Rite makes.

I also think that Landon's leather look can be worn throughout the year, versus only winters for suede. (IMO)

There is minimal padding in the shoe, which may or may not make a difference to you.

With Amazon's sales/discounts, I ordered several sizes/colors at about $15 a pair.

My husband hates my ""stocking up"" but he'll be thanking me later that we won't be scouting for dress shoes at the last minute! Plus - these will easily re-sell at the consignment store. :-)",Great dress shoe for the little man in your life :-),5.0,B000H882BO

-Everyone comments on how cute they are with the tires, chassis, and flashing lights.

-They're easy for her to put on and take off by herself.

-No one has noticed or commented that my daughter is wearing a ""boy's"" shoe.

"We just got a pair of these from Amazon, after dutifully going to the Striderite website, downloading its size chart, confirming that it was printed to accurate scale, then measuring our youngster's feet carefully. Unfortunately, we'll probably have to send them back.

We ordered a pair of these shoes that should -- theoretically, according to all our careful measuring -- have given us at least one half-size of extra room for growth, maybe even a tad more. Well, the shoes arrived and they fit just fine. The kid likes how they feel. *Today*, that is.

In other words, these shoes do not allow the extra size that we thought we ordered. If our kid grows at all in the next month, these shoes won't fit anymore. And they seem to be built pretty well, so it seems unlikely that they'd be worn out before they're outgrown. It'd be a big waste.

Why not just send them back and get a bigger size? Well, these shoes *are* bigger than the old ones -- on the *outside*. They provide more bulk, without a fully matching increase in interior space. As a result, our child had a couple of those awkward, feet-too-big missteps when first trying them on and walking around a bit. A kid can adjust to that kind of thing, but if they were yet another size bigger, I'd be worried about trips and falls.

Basically the shoe design seems to waste space, and does not accommodate as much foot as it claims. It might be okay for some kids, I guess, and the price right now on Amazon is pretty good compared to other shoes, from other manufacturers, at other retailers. So I'm giving them a half-hearted 4-star rating, despite our disappointment.

Every parent with growing children faces the problem of trying to get that little extra space in all the shoes and clothing they buy. So in these days of online shopping, you would hope that the manufacturers would get their acts together and be sure that they actually meet the specfications of the sizing charts they publish.

The shoes look okay. They're a little hard to put on, which might change after a breaking-in period, but it would surely be helpful if they put a pull-up strap on the back of the shoe, or on the tongue, as some other kids' shoes have for this age range.

Despite being almost too short for our child's feet, the shoes do seem to be comfortably (appropriately) wide in the sole, for a Medium size. That means they're basically accurate to the Striderite *width* chart, if you want to look at the bright side! Plus, the velcro straps seem to allow for some adjustment in that area, for kids who might be just slightly narrower or wider than average, or have a higher arch, or whatever.

We probably won't be able to give any real-world wear reports, but just looking at them, they seem likely to last much better than the New Balance lace-ups that we've fully outgrown, after a few months. Those other shoes looked worn after the first couple of weeks, and by now they're practically in tatters. But they fit great for most of that time, even when they were theoretically ""too big"" at the very beginning, and as a result we were able to really get our money's worth, which I don't think we'd be able to get from these. Oh well!","Seems sturdy, but beware sizing",4.0,B000Q7RS2K

"These shoes run a little long and narrow. My grandson wears a 7 1/2 XW but these are quite a bit too long and they are already snug in the width. I'm concerned about the width when they finally do fit the length. I think the XW is more like a wide and they run about 1/2 size long. I hope they will loosen up as they are worn and soften up. They are also quite a bit heavier than most other Stride Rite shoes, probably because of the light up part. The leather is on the hard side, not as soft and pliable as most of his other leather shoes.
They are well made, good shoes; nothing inside to rub and cause sores. The light up portion really does light up, better than others he's had. As long as you get the right size, I think they are worth the price.","Good quality, fun shoe, but run long and narrow",4.0,B000Q7U4BM

"I purchased size 7W when size 6.5W was the correct size because other reviews suggested these shoes run small.  I got two pairs because I have twins.  It turned out the size ran true, so 7W was too big.  I'm keeping them, however, because these are truly excellent shoes.  Further, I ordered size 6.5W, the true size of my twins' feet, and they fit well. But of all 4 pairs I ordered and received, none of them is W (the wide size).  In other words, even though I ordered these sizes wide, they came regular, not wide.

These arrived in little Keds shoe boxes and actually smelled like new sneakers are supposed to smell.  They're heavy for baby shoes relative to most brands.  Not in a bad way.  They're heavy because they're well constructed.  The sole is rubber and the rest is all that an adult shoe would be except on a miniature scale.

Other shoes we've purchased for our twin babies look like more than they are, but these Keds are geniune sneakers.  The price, comparing to other baby shoe prices, seems fair to me since I personally couldn't find a decent pair for less anyway online.

My babies figured out immediately how to take these off.  The loop canvas velcro fastener will be easy to put on their feet, but they'll be able to take them off on their own too.  You can make them as tight or loose as you want with this fastener.

I got the blue ones because that was the only color available at the time.  They look great and I'll be happy to use these when they grow into them.",Navy blue ones are good looking and well constructed.  Size was true.,3.0,B000QHHCZI

"To be honest, we purchased this shoe for two reasons:

1) My son loved the looks of it online
2) Daddy loved the price of $35 which is cheap for Stride Rite

Good:
This shoe is super easy for kids to get on or off.  It does have a cool look to them and with any Stride Rite, the quality and feel of the shoe is excellent.  We've had them for almost two months now and they are holding up as well as any shoe can for a 3 year old boy.

Bad:
We are all into shoes that have velcro for it makes going anywhere with the kids one less headache to mess with.  Unfortunately, this style of velcro just basically laps over the top of the shoe.  There is no ""loop"" it goes through where you can really get a good tight fit on the foot.  You can pretty much rig it where you get a decent, tight fit, but I think this sort of style is a bit too gimmicky.  I'd rather have a regular latching velcro system.

Bottom Line:
Great price.  Great style (looking) but the functionality of the velcro latch system would probably keep me from recommending to others.  It's not a bad shoe at all, but when you deal with Stride Rite and the price tag they come with, they better be 5 star shoes all around.  Sadly, these aren't, but if you are on a tight budget, these will work especially when compared to the cheaper store bought shoes you get for under $20.","Decent Shoe, Good Price",3.0,B000RFS0H8

"My 3yo is very particular about shoes, and much prefers the freedom of sandals.  Since that's not so practical in Michigan when it gets chilly, I decided to try these shoes out.

I love the color combination:  these shoes are black, tan, navy and orange, making them a very versatile shoe style-wise.  They seem very sturdy and I like the ""bumper"" on the toe.  One other thing the description doesn't mention is that these shoes come with a tag that says ""water friendly"" and they are.

"I purchased these hiking boots for my 7 year old daughter to use on our summer trips, after being disappointed by the total lack of children's hiking boots in local stores.  I was apprehensive about purchasing a shoe without trying it on first (especially because it was being shipped to us mid-vacation).  They arrived at my parent's home, and thankfully fit my daughter's feet perfectly.  She broke them in on trails in Minnesota state parks, and did not complain about them during that time (no blisters, just very mild soreness after the first day or two, and no issues after that).

Next they were used to hike in Mt. Rainier National Park, and they kept her feet comfortable on rocky trails and dirt trails, as well as for running around in the campground.  She wore them along the Oregon coast, hiking, and searching tidepools in rough, sharp rocks.  Then she wore them for an international trip.  She walked around European cities in them, hiked in the Black Forest National Park in Germany, and hiked in rugged parts of the Scottish Isles of Mull & Skye (wet and muddy places included), and camped in rainy conditions with these boots.

They worked as they should, maintained their waterproof functionality, and only have some cosmetic damage (scratches from sharp rocks) after all of that.  My daughter says she liked them, but on very hot days they made her feet feel too hot and sweaty.

These were my daughter's first hiking boots, so unfortunately I can't really do a comparison.",Worked very well for my 7 year old.,5.0,B000ULYTJM

Also, during the course of a regular outside play at school, she managed to tear the fabric completely off the toe, revealing the beige toe underneath the suede. Her toes were still protected, but it looked terrible. This isn't necessarily due to faulty manufacture; it's just that kids scuff the toes of their shoes.

In summary, these would probably be fine for fashion wear, but I wouldn't recommend for school. In total, they lasted us about a month before I had to throw them away.","Cute, but not durable, practical for toddlers",2.0,B000F52ACG
"These shoes were way to expensive for the quality.  It is made of a very thin ""leather""-barely wipe off-and the bottom of the soles are open all the way thru to the opposite side-so they collect all the dirt and dust the child has come into contact.  At the end of the first day these shoes look as if they have been worn for a year.  It was awful.  Can't believe I spent that much money on them.  The material is so thin (what is suppose to be leather-but is not)  it will never withstand even 1/2 a school year.",poor quality,2.0,B000TFH20M

"My son has to wear special shoes called ""dafos"" which are bulky. However, we have to find regular kid shoes to go OVER the dafos - which is extremely hard. After searching in stores, I turned online and I looked at these because it said they were extra wide. So I bought these hoping it would work for him and it did! These shoes are wonderful and fit amazingly well over his dafos. I love them.",Great Shoes,5.0,B000N1ZZ06

"This is a very good kid shoe. It's light, tough, and airy for your kids feet. Velcro straps are a plus for easy use. I just wish they have more sizes and colors to choose from so I can continue to purchase this product when my kid outgrows his size.

Great fun for a kid. Takes a little bit of practice to learn to balance before they can really take off. Do warn your child to make sure to tie their laces before running after the ice cream truck or there will be multiple lacerations to proudly show off for days to come.,Great fun,5.0,B000JZ9SFE
"This is my son's second pair of the same shoe!  I am a bit of a children's shoe critic, especially since my son really needs a well built shoe due to some low muscle tone issues which results in pretty flat feet.  Having said that, this shoe offers excellent support while being a slip-on!  For a preschooler there is nothing better than having a shoe that you just slip on and off...while offering great support for running and jumping!  I can't say enough positive things about the shoe...and everywhere we go people ask me where we got him such a nice shoe!",The BEST shoe!,5.0,B000OWBVZC

I buy stride rite shoes for my son because they are durable and comfortable for him. I gave this product a 3 only because of the color.

-A youth shoe that employs powerpulse technology for optimal kicking power
-Eva insole for comfort
-Split outsole for optimal weight and flexibility
