"My garden clogs make my feet look huge, and even with socks I had to order a smaller size.  Generally I can count on being an easy 7, but had to buy a 6, and still have quite a bit of room.  I use these in the yard, at the pool, riding my bike, shopping and have even been known to accidentally wear them to work.  They are more comfy than sneakers, and have wonderful arch supports built in - important for me and a heel spur I have been dealing with for a number of years now.  Teenagers seem to think they are cool too, and the navy upper really might pass as leather if you don't look too close.  Great with jeans.
Happy feet when I'm in my clogs!",Graceless and Immense - Comfy and Cool,5.0,B00004VWJ3
"These shoes were recommended to me by a several coworkers and friends of mine. We work in the Veterinary nursing field, which involves a lot of standing, kneeling, etc. I bought both the 39 and the 40 as I can go either way with different brands. The 39s fit perfectly around my foot, but my toes were smushed and hitting the front of the shoe. The 40s were so big that even with socks on they flopped like flip flops when I walked, which was a deal breaker for me, so I returned them.","Too small or too big, they did not fit.",2.0,B00004VWJ3

"I've owned probably a dozen pair of this shoe over the years, I've been wearing something else recently and was excited to get back to this old trustworthy shoe.  It seems like something has changed in the sizing.  I've been a 48 in birkenstock of all types since I first purchased birkenstock.  I did once have to buy a smaller size (46) because I was in a bind and I ended up buying another (correct, 48) pair a couple weeks later.  This feels like that smaller sized shoe, like a 46.  The box says 48, the inside of the shoe says 48, it's disappointing",did the sizes change?,2.0,B00004VWJ3

"I have plantar, I work in the OR, so I am on my feet all day. My foot doctor told me I needed cork bottom shoes to wear. He also mentioned (spenco foot support) which i got from academy sports.
When I tell you the first day is the worst because your feet have to adjust. The 2nd day I was fine! My feet do not  hurt when I wear cork bottom shoes. I have slippers I wear that are cork bottoms.
What also helps is soaking your feet in ice cold cold cold water after a long day. It helps.

"What can I say, they are All Stars Chuck Taylors.  They've been around forever and with good reason.  They are comfortable, look great especially when you keep the white leather clean.  These shoes are no different.  They can stand to have a little more support in them for all-day wear but perhaps a better sock or insert would help in that department.  Other than that, I have no complaints.  I'm female, but I ordered from the men's selections because of the availability in sizes and color.  Plus the men's style seemed to look a bit different...not as pointy in the front.  The size fit well and the color looks great as expected.  Overall, it's a great buy.",They're Chuck Taylors...What's Not to Like?,4.0,B000094VPP
"Loves my Chucks :) Forcthe record Converse Chuck Taylor's only come in Men size which can be unisex as women can order men's sneakers 2 sizes smaller than your normal size. Now with Chucks since wide and like no support at all women should probably order 2.5 sizes smaller than your normal size. However since no support if you are like me and use an insert then 2 size smaller should fit you just right. I'm normally a 7 in women's, ordered the 5 in men's which were a little big but after adding my insert they fit just right :) Loves these as I can wear with shorts, skirt, jeans or a dress. Light weight and very breathable make them the perfect summer shoe.",Perfect Summer Shoe,5.0,B000094VPP

"The size guide clearly shows that you are ordering in men's sizes.  I ordered a size 7B(M).  That is a size & in MEN'S.  That is a size 9 in women's .  What I received was a size 5 men's which is a size 7 in women's.  I find that to be the biggest pain in the butt.  It is hard enough to order Converse.  Amazon vendors don't make it any easier.  Some vendor sizes say men's sizes but the verbiage says stuff like, ""These are really women's sizes- so order them in your regular size- but make sure they are 1/2 size smaller than usual!""  errrrgg..  Converse are worth the 1/2 size calculation and even the men's vs. the women's nonsense- but when the vendor simply puts the wrong sex on the sizing chart- THAT is unacceptable.  Now, I have a shoe that is two sizes too small.  And I have to return them.  Thank GOD I ordered them via PRIME membership or I would be paying $17 shipping.  Wouldn't that be a real winner?

"Love these shoes, an old throwback that is having another great fashion moment.  These Kswiss are super comfortable and can easily be worn walking all around town, far more comfy than Chucks.  4 stars because they do run a bit big, as I believe it is just a larger cut shoe.  I normally wear and 8 and occasionally an 8.5.  I got an 8 in these and wish I would have gotten a 7,5",Love these shoes,4.0,B0000A51F0
"Bought this [Black, 6B(M)] for my mother because she loves K-Swiss shoes. The shoes were good quality and lightweight! However, the top of the shoe (toe area) ran a bit narrow, so while the rest of the shoe was comfortable, she could not wear it for long because it hurt her toes. There weren't any left in size 6 E unfortunately; however, I'd recommend getting a wide size shoe if your feet are a bit on the wide side.

Pros:
* Lightweight (great for wearing to work that requires a lot of walking or standing)
* Comfortable (if in the correct size)
* Good quality, durable

Cons:
* May run a bit narrow at the toe region (different for everyone though)",Good quality and Lightweight,4.0,B0000A51F0
"These are not the K-Swiss's I'm used to. The classics that I love have always been soooooo soft and comfortable. I just can't find them in stores anymore. I've always worn them in this size and these feel NOTHING like the classics I love. These have like no padding. I'm young and i can handle it, but not at all what I was expecting. I also fit into a boys size and these feel like the boys classics. Same look, but different amount of cushioning and slightly wide. These shoes are also stiffer than the K-Swiss's I'm used to. I would not recommend to anyone.","If you've ever worn a pair of real K-Swiss classics, you'll be disappointed in these",2.0,B0000A51F0

I have been wearing this same shoe for years.  This is the first time I ordered them online and didn't know the difference between some of the lettering in the size chart.  I got what I thought I would need.  They are a little bit too wide but not terrible and since I only wear them in winter I know I can wear thick socks with them and all will be great.  It is my opinion that these shoes are made very well and they last a long time before I have to replace them.

"got these for nursing school because they are all-white, and thought that they would be comfortable all day,being that they are sneakers. they are not. there is very little support, and I was hurting from the ball of my foot all the way up to my lower back the very first day that I wore them at the hospital. I gave it the college try and wore them for a week and a half. 'give them a chance to 'break in', I thought. . . it only got worse. steer clear. it is unfortunate, but there are pretty much no cute shoes that are both all white AND comfortable for anyone over the age of 25 that needs to be on their feet all day. go with brooks or new balance walkers. both brands are ugg-butt, but comfy! it aint cute walking funny the next day, either--so it all evens out. don't bother with leather chuck taylors or adidas shell-toes, either. trust me. save yourself some time and just get the right shoes in the first place.

"I wanted a weightlifting shoe, and these fit the bill perfectly. They're fairly straightforward: some canvas and a big slab of rubber for the sole. Mostly comfortable, but nothing great.

"This original st329 is so much better in my opinion than the CMF ST329. The arch support is so much more noticeable than in the CMF.

"I do not understand why these shoes got such good reviews.  I bought them for nursing school clinicals because everyone said they were so awesome.  I did not like the way they looked because they were so bulky but who cares if they feel great?  Such weird shoes.  They have such a large front part and such stiff soles I felt like a duck walking around.  The front slaps down hard because they are so bulky and stiff, and actually made my ankles sore from working so hard.  Wore them 5 or 6 times thinking maybe they would wear in a little.  Nope.

The last time I had a pair of these i was in the fourth grade and they cost about seven dollars.  I remember because they fell apart fairly quickly and my father chewed me out for ruining a seven dollar pair of shoes.  Well now they're about 33 dollars a pair and I'm almost 49 and I suspect I'll take better care of my Chucks this time...,Retro to the fourth grade...,5.0,B0000CFJY7
These are exactly what I was expecting. Simple shoes that seem to have a quality construction. I have worn them most days of the last two weeks and nothing wrong yet. I will update if I feel like they break too soon. A common fault of shoes like this is for the sole to separate from the shoe where your toes meet your foot. The regular stress and bending can wear them out quickly.,Quite nice,4.0,B0000CFJY7
"The last time I wore a pair of chucks was back in the early 80's. They are just as I remembered them. They are comfortable and easy to break in, plus my feet don't hurt after wearing them all day. Awesome shoes!! I'll be buying another pair.",Great shoes,5.0,B0000CFJY7

"I was very disappointed in this shoe.  I had last year's model of this shoe and loved it.  It was very supportive and I did a lot of running in them.  As expected, they wore out  over time so I got this newer model a month ago.  I hate them.  Someone mentioned the oversized tongue and that was the first thing I felt when putting them on.  They are no where as supportive as the older model.  If you compare the two there is at least 1/4 inch less arch support.  This new sneaker has an insert inside rather than the shoe itself being as supportive.  I had shin splints the first week of running in these, which indicated I was using new muscles due to different support.  They squeak and have some sort of leak as I see condensation in the ""air bubble"" on the bottom of the shoe.  They are attractive and comfortable if you are just going to walk around in them and use them for fashion, but if you have flat feet and run, I would not recommend these.  I actually just bought the old model on clearance here online and wish I did that to start as I would have saved myself $120, but the new ones were much better looking and not so much like grandma's orthotic shoe.",Not as supportive as last year's model,1.0,B0000DZA4T
"I purchased this shoe on the recommendation of my podiatrist.  I over pronate terribly, plus I'm hyperflexible, so I need the most stabilizing shoe I can get.  I wear a C width -- just in the wide range -- yet this shoe is narrow and pinches in the toes.  It also bends in an awkward place, cutting across the top of the foot.  True, I probably wouldn't roll my ankles in these shoes...but most likely because I won't be wearing them.  Very disappointing.",Disappointed at $90,2.0,B0000DZA4T
"If you have flat feet and/or need a stable, motion control shoe, this may be the shoe for you.

I have run in Saucony, Asics, Brooks, Reebok, NB, and Nike.  This is by far the best shoe so far for me.

I have trouble finding a comfortable running shoe with most brands because the arch support is too high.  Not so with this shoe.  I love the wider platform and stability.  The wider toe box is a plus, especially if your feet tend to swell while running in hot weather.",Motion control AND comfort (who knew that you could have both),5.0,B0000DZA4T
"I find these shoes to be very stable.  The outside of the shoes, on the inside by the arches, look a little like old lady shoes because of the support.  When I'm wearing these shoes, my ankles are really straight (I overpronate).  Yes, the shoes have a very wide toe box, which is good for me.  I have a narrow heel and have been able to tie the shoes to keep my heels from slipping.  I wear them to the gym and at home when I am working around the house.",Love these shoes,4.0,B0000DZA4T

"I had a pair of these same shoes - last year's color, which lasted me for almost a year.  I need strong arch support & this provided a comfortable option.  Some of the other firm supports were too rigid.  In the entire time of wearing my old ones, I never had any blisters or calluses. They are still in decent condition and the exterior leather has lasted, as well as the soles.  My primary reason for replacement for running is that I could tell they had gotten worn out in the support, however, I'm still using them as a cross-trainer.
Would definitely recommend these as an excellent shoe that wears very well!!",Excellent full-support shoe & long lasting.,5.0,B0000DZA4T

I don't necessarily have bad knees, but I do feel less stress on my knees when running in these shoes.  They do not feel heavy on your feet at all. I will order these again.  I may order a half size bigger next time.  I normally wear a 9 and that's what I ordered.

Yes, they are a little orthotic looking, but if you pronate you have no choice.  The tongue is a little hard to smooth down, you have to run your fingers over it each time you lace up.  I'll take that for the comfort that I have in these.  I wear a regular width in these, by the way, where I normally wear a D.

"I just got these specifically for running. I am not a marathon runner - maybe 12-15 miles per week. As another reviewer said, shoes are a very personal thing, but I absolutely love these.  They are really comfortable out of the box and the arch support is great. A good shoe for someone like me that has some ankle flex when they run (they do a good job stabilizing the foot). I got a 1/2 size bigger for running.",Love these shoes!,5.0,B0000DZZP3

"I've been buying Saucony since the Jazz series back in the 1980's.  The Hurricane line has had some big mistakes, such as Hurricane 9 & 10.  But they finally got it right with the 11.  The fit is great (I wear one size larger than normal for my marathon runs)

"I was a die-hard fan of the original Jazz running shoe until it became a ""sneaker."" The original Jazz eventually morphed into a cheapy senior-look leisure shoe...the indignity!  Why was that ever allowed to happen? I should have bought two dozen pairs way-back-when when I found that I liked the fit, comfort, stability and durability of the Jazz and later Jazz Grid.

I fast-walk 4 miles daily M-F on a university track and have been doing so since the early '80s so I know which shoe of those I've tried over the years delivers what I want/need in a running shoe. After the demise of the Jazz-as-I-knew-it and years of pinched toes/blackened toe nails, quickly worn-out outsoles from Adidas et al, it took me awhile to rediscovered the curved last, generous toe area and narrow heel area of the Jazz in the Hurricane 11 Progrid running shoe. Fit and comfort at last. Should buy a dozen before these morph...

Not crazy about the look though--that segmented bulbous heel...Not attractive. And the over-the-top visual busyness of the shoe top. How about a more minimalist, stream-lined look? Also, do wish Saucony would come out with REAL COLORS other than the boring whites w/ baby blue or other pastel accents they offer.  Docked it 1 star for aesthetics.",Tops for fast-walk comfort+stabilty on track; so-so on looks,4.0,B0000DZZP3
My selection of running shoes is limited since the front of my foot is wide and my heel is rather narrow.  This shoe works for me by hugging my heel without having to tie my shoes tightly.  It's also a fairly stable shoe so my knees like the Hurricanes also.,Just Do It,5.0,B0000DZZP3
"I had a problem with Hurricane 10s and had to use my old inserts in them but the Hurricane 11s are good out of the box! I liked them so much I ordered another pair. After the disaster with the 10s, I was afraid that 12s might be bad!",Love these shoes!,5.0,B0000DZZP3
Great shoe and great service. I received them in the mail in just a few days after I made the purchase! Terrific shoe for long distance running and mid-weight females. Shoes are solid for approx 300-325 miles of hard running. I have narrow heels and they fit nice and snug around my foot.  Previously had trouble with Nike and Addidas not fitting my foot well and needing a little more motion control than the shoes I was wearing. Been wearing this model shoe since early 2004 and won't stop until Saucony stops making it. Relatively lightweight shoe and dries out quickly as well.

"I owned hurricane 9s and loved them, but the 11 seems loose and my heel comes up out of the shoe.

Wish I hadn't worn them once so I could send them back.",Too wide and loose,2.0,B0000DZZP3

"This is my third pair of Saucony Hurricanes and I continue to love them!  I previous had version 8 and 10, and I was a bit worried that they'd change the design, but from what I can tell it is almost exactly the same.  They fit perfectly right out of the box and I immediately went for a run and had zero ""breaking in"" issues -- no blisters,  no soreness, no poor fitting, no issues whatsoever.  The two differences I can see are the the base seems a little thicker in the 11 - -which is great -- and the midfoot seems a little wider -- also good for me.  As far as fit and style, I see no differences from the 10.

I have feet/knee ""issues"" that these shoes work wonders for.  I had knee surgery, I pronate a lot, and I have a triangular shaped foot with wide toe spread and narrow ankles (it comes from growing up barefoot in Hawaii -- your toes spread out!).  So if that sounds like you, I'd recommend this shoe.  It has good stabilization and a wide toe box.

The quality of these shoes is impressive.  I work out a lot (5x/week) and so I replace my shoes about once a year.  My Saucony 10s still have a lot of life left in them, but due to aforementioned knee issues, I try to replace shoes before my knees start complaining.  The only thing is that I had to replace the shoelaces about 6 months in.  Oh, and the very last shoe lace holes (right at the top of the shoe's tongue) started to break/fray recently, which encouraged me to buy the 11s.

Finally, I got the black/silver version which look quite cool and I think will age more gracefully than the white/blues that I've had previously.",Great right out of the box! & Just like 8s and 10s,5.0,B0000DZZP3
"I run about three miles a day with a long run on the weekend and I love these shoes!  I found them through a local running shoe store and was thrilled when I had no trouble running five miles the first time out.  I've had them a year now and went back to that same shoe store to buy a new pair, but they didn't have my size this time.  I bought the gel keyano as a replacement, but I did not like them nearly as much as the Hurricane.  Since I found these here for a fantastic price ($81-$87 compared to $140 on[...]) I'm going to return the other shoes.

"I have somewhat narrow (not super skinny--a narrow-ish ""B"")  feet,  and although these sandals will adjust to my foot if I pull enough, I end up with a  absurdly long""tail"" ---so long it has to be tucked under and then looped again into a loose knot.  (see images of the tail attached)  This is not such a huge deal unless you are in India going in and out of temples every five minutes.  If you have REALLY skinny feet (like a true AA, or AAA,  find a different sandal--you will break your neck on the endless laces)

So,  these shoes are somewhat short in length  (go up 1/2 size) and really wide (I would call the normal short lace tuck as in the marketing pictures a ""C"" width) .  They are however, *supremely comfortable*, so I'm keeping them and dealing with the long pull and ""tuck and loop"".

(I just notice, that Amazon  states above that I bought a 5 B, lol.  I have no idea where that came from.  Try doubling that and more--I bought a 10.5 ""B""  (in reality ""C"")  I am normally a 10 B/AA.",A tad challenging if you have narrow feet......,4.0,B0000V9E3S

I ordered the smallest size available, and they could be a little smaller for me. I ordered the same size I'd bought the year before in a sportswear store, but they did run larger. The arch didn't fit exactly where I'd prefer, but my feet found a relatively sweet spot over time. I love the Reef shoes. They have great arch support, and feel like I'm walking on squishy rubber balls. After foot surgery I've got tender soles, so these solve that problem. I live in these during warm weather.

"I bought my first pair of these in FL while on vacation.  I'm heavy and have a wider foot and had been looking for new flip flops before our trip.  My flip flops broke while on vacation.  We went into The Flop Shop and I tried on a lot.  This pair was amazing.  They were expensive as I was used to paying less than ten bucks for flip flops but I've worn them for a year and they are amazing.  They are so supportive and cushiony.  I bought this pair on Amazon to make sure I had a backup pair!  I clean house twice a week and wore these once to see how my feet did.  My feet did not hurt at all.  As a matter of fact, at home I walk around barefoot and if my feet start hurting, I put these shoes ON for relief!",Best flops around,5.0,B0001M3UWW
"I have worn Reef's for many years. I have a very high arch and narrow foot so it can be a challenge to find a snug enough fit. These sandals envelope my foot and embed it far enough that it gives great support. The arch is superior to any Reef sandal I've tried. They are not too light and therefore are more durable. While I only wear these indoors as a house slipper, I am sure they would be comfortable walking over most road surfaces, including gravel.  I don't suggest that this sandal is only for narrow feet. Through repeated wearings they have grown much looser on my foot, but that is what I have grown to expect considering most sandals are made for and average size feet. I highly recommend these sandals.",Very comfortable and the best cushion and arch support,5.0,B0001M3UWW

One thing that kinda sucks but doesn't change the comfort or sturdiness of the sandal is that they are soo so squeaky!! There is no way you can sneak around in these.

"If you enjoy the comfort and style of Tevas or Eccos, these are not for you. The fit is very very wide, and the toebox is low.  Keen's advice is to order a size larger, but that doesn't help the low toebox problem.  Plusses: they do protect your toes (while cramming the nail).  They withstand wet weather.  They are apparently indestructible.  They offer enough protection that you can wear them in the winter, provided you aren't actually stepping in slush.  Minuses: they are really ugly.  They make my feet look big, sort of like Sasquatch.  Keen makes two styles that aren't quite as ugly (Rose and Bali), but only in limited colors and the popular sizes (7 - 9) are often unavailable.  These will make your feet sweat, but this can be countered with foot powder.  They aren't really a sandal; they are a shoe with holes in the side.  They are very difficult to get on and off, until you discover the trick of putting your index finger through the loop at the back and pulling with all your strength. Why did I buy and then keep them?  I have a deformed toenail and I need to hide it, at least until it grows out..

"It's a nice pair of shoes but I don't get the hype on converses. They're gorgeous but have absolutely no arch support. As someone with an injury, it's a horrible choice. I could usually handle shoes with minimal support but if you're looking for shoes for comfort, these aren't it. They look nice but if you have flat feet, it looks a bit weird in my opinion. When I put my insoles into them, it's a bit more of a tight fit but works so I think in the future I will order a blue or black. I didn't like the beige-ish color I purchased as almost all my clothes are dark colored. If the shoes are gonna be light, they gotta at least offer support for me, haha.

"My quest to find black Western boots to fit my size 5 feet was like Goldilocks and Cinderella.

I have short, wide feet with high insteps and the beginnings of a bunion to top it all off. I really wear a 5, but I gave up on that idea when shopping for Western boots, because mostly they start at a 6. Luckily, Ariat starts at a 5.5. Because of my fitting issues, I made SURE the boots I was considering had free returns!
So I ordered a 5.5 wide Ariat boot in a style that was not 100% to my taste and they were...meh. They were okay, but I was not really thrilled, AND they were too loose. Then I ordered another pair of Ariat boots in a 5.5 medium in a different style that I loved. I LOVED them, but I could hardly pull them over my insteps and, once I did get them on, my insteps were on fire and I was afraid I have to get someone to cut them off my feet. And the baffling part was that they they were actually too loose in the toe.

UGH. I finally ordered ANOTHER pair in a different style that was really what I had in mind when I first realized I had to have black Western boots. I obsessively checked the tracking, even though they were sent Prime, LOL.

As I opened the door to go to work this morning, THERE WAS THE PACKAGE!! I immediately took off the army boots I had on and put on this pair and it was angels singing!!!!!!! They fit like they were made for me and I LOVE LOVE LOVE them. They feel like I have worn them forever. Needless to say, they stayed on my feet and I'm sitting here, admiring them as I teach kindergarten, on my feet all day.

Goldilocks because of the 3 pairs. Cinderella because of the fit and the happy ending!! They are perfect and now I think I might need a pair in brown...

UPDATE: Well, you know I DID need a pair in brown! In an effort to find a brown pair pair of Ariats that I loved and that fit well, I ordered FIVE pairs in different styles/widths from this same listing.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ariat-Women-s-Heritage-Western-R-Toe-Western-Cowboy-Boot-Distressed-Brown-5-5-B-US/dp/B0009ETWR4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ariat Women's Heritage Western R Toe Western Cowboy Boot, Distressed Brown, 5.5 B US</a>&nbsp;Thanks, Amazon, for allowing me the latitude to order enough pairs of cowboy boots with FREE RETURNS so that I can fit my ""special"" feet.

The intention was to return all but my favorite brown pair. SO, I absolutely fell in love with the distressed brown pair. They are casual and comfy, like a beloved pair of worn-in boots. They're distressed, so I won't need to worry about scuffing them, or jerking my feet out of the way when my kindergartners rush up and are about to tromp on my new boots.

I was all ready to print the return labels for the other 4 pairs when I noticed what a GREAT deal I'd gotten on the russet rebel ones. This pair is exactly the same style as the black ones, although they are lined somehow, and so not as soft as the black ones). The russet rebels are more dressy than my distressed brown, but will be beautiful with both jeans and skirts. I knew that if I returned them, I'd be kicking myself and eventually want to buy them again...so I can live with keeping the kindergartners off my feet for another year and a half (till I retire, LOL). Am I too old for cowboy boots? NO, LOL. Age is a number and these boots look great on me when worn with appropriate clothing (no mini skirts), if I do say so myself.

So, yeah. That's how I wound up with THREE pairs of wonderful Ariat boots. LOVE THEM!!!!!

These shoes seem to be either seconds or possibly knock-offs.  The front part of the shoe fits very close and the back it very loose.  The leather finish on the left shoe does not match the right - the left is pebbly and stiff, the right is smooth and soft (I prefer the right).  I need to wear thin socks to prevent the left shoe from pinching my toes, but this makes the backs even looser.","poor quality, not comfortable",2.0,B0002LI9BO

"This is my second pair of these Easy Spirit Sport shoes. I do not like ordering shoes on line but my local shoe store no longer carries them. I ordered them in black so they could go with just about everything. Not for heavy duty athletic activity, the shoes are very comfortable and I especially appreciate their slenderizing appearance...not ""clunky"" looking at all. I ordered a wide width to accommodate bunions. There is not as much arch support as you will find in a heavier walking shoe but it is an extremely nice leather. They fit very well however the wide width does result in a very slight gap near the outside top of the shoe. In my opinion, this does not affect wear, comfort or appearance and will be minimized by wearing socks.

"These came in a Sperry box that said ""Made In Indonesia"" but then the inside of the shoes said ""Made In Dominican Republic."" They definitely seemed fake to me. On top of that, the bottoms were pretty scuffed and dirty, as if they had already been slightly worn before. I had ordered a 9 W in women's and they were still pretty snug on the sides, which was a surprise ordering wide. The toes were quite long though and a little too big, so the sizing was definitely weird. We compared them to a pair of original Sperrys my dad owned and there were definitely some differences in appearance and texture. Leather was much rougher on these ones and the markings on the bottoms were different. For the same price as originals, save your time and just get the originals. At least they're guaranteed to be authentic.",Fake and Poor Quality,1.0,B0002LTCWY
I ordered these shoes to replace an older pair of the exact same shoe. I wear an 8.5 W and the shoes that were sent were marked as my size but they were far too narrow to actually BE my size.

"Although the leather seems lighter weight and less padded than the same model I bought several years ago, it is still a very good comfortable shoe.  The ones I bought 15 years have lasted so well and are the most comfortable shoe I've ever owned.  So, I was happy to find it again on Amazon.  Like everything else these days, the logo is different (so maybe Naturalizer has been sold?) and the quality and workmanship are not as sterling as before.  However, there are no defects in the shoe and I just wore it on a long trip that involved a lot of walking on concrete and black top parking lots.  They were very comfortable and no problems. So, I would recommend this shoe.  I wear 9.5 medium and need a roomy toe.  These are true to size.  If you sometimes need a wide rather than medium you will need to order wide.

"Made in China...it changes everything!

A note of explanation:  I consider myself a very ""international"" person, very multi-cultural in interest and education.  Many of my closest friends come from other countries, and I often joke that I practice reverse discrimination.  I was a foreign language major from a name school, with a graduate degree decades later in ethnic-American lit from an Ivy.  I LOVE well-made things from interesting places.  But made in modern-day China does not seem to qualify, at least in the ""well made"" category.

Yes, I am probably keeping these Scout sandals.  They are basically the same shoe as my beloved Scout sandals made by that same firm some decades back, which I have periodically replaced, noting changes in fit, softness of leather (or lack thereof), and overall look.  They have gone from dainty and almost glove-like leather some 30 years ago, to more cumbersome and stiffer some decades back.  These, however, are positively cloddy looking and the so-called ""leather upper"" seems to be a thin layer attached to vinyl or, worse yet, plastic.  The style is the same, the brand the same, but the origination, materials, and even fit (thanks to varying shoe lasts) are far different.

All that being said, where in the world can I find traditional shoes in a 7 Narrow?  Our beloved bargain chain, Building 19, used to carry small narrows (as well as every other size variant), but just closed their doors forever.  So I am stuck.  These will serve.  They are a tad wider than the former  Naturalizer Scout narrows., but they are wearable.  I have others that are slightly better, purchased in previous years as extras.  These will be tucked away, farther back, until I am out of options.  The Naturalizer and also the Easy Spirit outlets-- not too far from us-- used to carry my size.  Now it's rare, the costs silly, and the styles unsuitable for someone mid-60's who really doesn't want to change with the times.  So...a big THANK YOU to Bealls of Florida, still carrying my TYPE products.  A big vote of ""NO!"" for Chinese manufacture as it is now practiced.  My assumption is that Communism, followed probably by greed, has changed the wonderful artisan look of Asian goods from China of eons gone by.  But I will do what I must not to become ""descalzada,"" like shoeless religious of monasterial origin.

A post script:  To those of you with similarly small, narrow feet, do look at Walking Cradles, also available through Amazon.  Their flats are soft leather, heavenly comfortable, but not inexpensive.  High heel styles are beautiful, equally good quality, but run small.","STILL MADE ON THE SAME PLANET?...My search for classic, comfy footware",3.0,B0002LTGHA

Update: I received the size 7 and I love them. It is the tiniest bit tight across, but I do have a bunion there that is the cause of the tightness since the other shoe fits perfect.

"I was delighted to find out that Keds still makes the sneakers I bought as a kid. I just wore out the last pair I had -- I purchased extras at least twenty years ago, so haven't had to look for new till now. Well, almost the same sneaker... These don't seem to be made to the same last as the old models; they aren't quite as good a fit, but are still pretty comfortable, and the sole is still flexible and light weight. The inside is lined with a terry-like material -- an improvement, I think, if it holds up to wear. The colored stripe around the outside of the bottom is gone.

"Keds Champion Original Canvas had been a classic icon that was reliable year after year. Well, something has changed with Keds, and not for the better. I've been a 8S for decades and buy many pairs of shoes every year. I wanted a fresh pair of white Keds for vacation, so I bought these and initially they were perfect (as assumed). After I returned from vacation, I ran them through the washing machine (NOT THE DRYER) as I always have in the past, but this time the canvas shrunk considerably. It's apparent that the fabric is ""cheaper"" as the washed misshapen fabric stretches across the toe of the shoe weirdly and it feels significantly shorter when on my foot. Trying to be a good sport about it, I wore the shoes yesterday and even after 4 hours of wear on my feet, the toe box was still shrunken. I don't believe that Keds customers should be expected not to wash WHITE Keds. I'd send the them back but the return window has ended.  Uncomfortable Keds are an oxymoron that I'm not willing to keep, so I'll be donating these shoes and buying something else. There are knock-offs of this classic shoe out there that are 1/3 the price, but my expectation of them would be ""cheap"".

Bought 6.5 XW black. Love these shoes my old pair was 3 years old and the sole was coming apart.  I agree with most of the other reviews that the new design isn't as wide as the previous design.  I remember when I got my old pair they fit me perfectly and the sides weren't digging into my pinky toes.  I'm hoping that after some wear they will stretch since I just need maybe about 1cm more of room or less which is why I'm deducting one star.

"These are very comfortable and very warm! They have a nice solid sole but not so thick that you trip when you walk. I got the blue and they are really cute.  I read the review that said they run a little small so I ordered a size up. I wear an 8 or 8.5 (depending).. I ordered the 9-10 and they are a bit big. Not falling off my foot big, but I have extra room. If they stretch over time I may be in trouble!  When you first put them on they feel snug because of the fur lining, but after you wear them your foot sinks into it. I'm not sure if the 7-8 would have been too small.. but.. If I get another pair of these I will probably get the 7-8.
It would be great if they came in half sizes, but since they don't order carefully.
They really do feel good on my feet...I hope they hold up! Time will tell.",Super comfortable.. trouble with sizing,5.0,B0002M1OJW

"These Chillax are not the padded shoes of the former Ortholite shoes Keds once made.  These shoes are meant for low-level activity, such as an office worker, or a teacher who stays behind his desk. who doesn't walk much while at work.  They slip on and off easily and can easily be tossed into a beach bag or weekend bag for a quick get away.

My experience with Keds is the uneven quality control.  Some shoes are well-made with tough seams.  Other shoes look like factory rejects sold at clearance price to rid the factory of its stock.

"Love Love Love these shoes, they are the most comfortable shoes in the world and I mean that. I am so happy with these shoes I will most certainly buy more pairs, just as some others have voiced. You can wear these shoes all day and your feet will be comfortable all day and night, they are fully padded inside and the vamps are higher also which gives you a lift especially if you are short like I am. They feature a good quality canvas upper and quality stitching all around. I am currently wearing them just around my home as house shoes, sometimes I even forget I am wearing them because they are so comfortable that I accidently wear them outside, that's how comfortable Grasshoppers are. In my opinion these shoes should be renouned for comfort. Believe I will continue to purchase these shoes as long as they make them. I recommend these shoes to everyone who is seeking a quality made most comfortable shoe. And a big plus they even supply you with a shipping label with your order, that's the sign of a confident manufacturer. Added to my review this is a update to my last review, these Grasshopper Jensens slip on shoes is that they did not last as long as I thought or expected to last it is now a year later and their are signs of wear these shoes were only worn inside my home and never worn outside my home, this latest update will not deter me from purchasing these most comfortable shoes however it will be a disappointment as far as how long they last, this is the only disappointment I have with this brand.",Grasshoppers Women's Jensen Twill Sliip On Shoes STONE,4.0,B0002MB9BK

"After reading the reviews here on Amazon and on a competitor's site, it sounded like these would be perfect walking shoes for my upcoming trip abroad. When they arrived, I was pleased with the softness of the upper, and the slight stretchiness conformed to the foot nicely. However, the size of the sole was off; I usually wear an 11, and ordered an 11W to allow for thick socks, but the sole was at least 1/2"" too long, and 1/4"" too narrow, which dug into the sides of my feet. Perhaps because of the slight heel, the shoe didn't want to stay on, letting my heel slip up with every step and causing irritation after only a few minutes even with socks. The shaft hugged the ankle nicely, due to the slight stretch, but the upper edge flared out strangely, even more strangely considering my larger-than-average calves.

"I got these for $15 and, at that price, are totally worth it. I wear a 7M in Keds and these fit as expected.  The canvas/off white color doesn't hide dirt well at all and I expected that it happen. I mostly got these as shoes I could get dirty without being too upset. One of my dogs likes to step on my feet when I take her out in public. For some reason, placing one of her paws on the top of one of my feet keeps her calm. As a result, all of my shoes/sandals that I wear when I take her out and about seem to get unusually dirty -- thus, I bought a pair of shoes just to take her out in.

"Love these boots. I'm not someone who needs a wider circumference in the calf area of the boot because I happen to have thin legs and though I have muscular calves, they are not big. These boots look great and I don't like them to be too big around my calves.  I know they make a style that fits wider calves but these were great for me and still left a nice amount of room for my skinny jeans. They are not tight by any stretch of the imagination but I have other tall shaft boots that are way too wide in circumference and they are just right for me.  They also fit great overall and are nice and comfortable. This is my first White Mountain purchase and I have to say I'm very pleasantly surprised. These boots look like a lot more money than what I paid! I will definitely buy more from this brand. I got the black and they look like real leather.

I tried these boots on when I received them, and they felt as if there was no padding, but thought the issue was more with the socks that I had on. I thought , to be fair, I needed to ""break them in"", wear more cushioned socks, and wear them a few times. Fast forward  about 4 uses.....They are absolutely hard and uncomfortable with no cushion, and they kill the balls of my feet. By the end of the day, my feet are absolutely crying, and I have a desk job!! Would not recommend, and will most likely end up donating to the local Goodwill store.",Uncomfortable,2.0,B0002MBCW6

Fits great (you must wear them a few times to break them in before they get really comfortable, especially if you have larger calf circumference like me. Mine were a little tight around at first, but after a few wears, now fit wonderfully). The boots are beautiful, and as far I can tell, well made. No, they are not real leather, but at this awesome price, who cares?!

"These are my very first pair of Clarks. I have wide feet and I've always worn a 6.5 in pretty much everything, but I saw these boots on Endless and fell in love with them so I ordered a 6.5W and 6W. The 6.5W were too big! I labeled these true to size since I've never actually tried a shoe in Wide before. The 6W fit like a glove and they are BEAUTIFUL! The braiding detail on the piece that wraps around the back of the heel is so pretty and the boots are a SOOOOFT buttery suede leather. They just reek of rich!! The shaft circumference is 15"".  I have muscular cavles so they're slightly tight when zipping them up, but I can still fit them over skinny jeans.  (Most boots I cannot zip up at all so kudos!)

Excellent craftsmanship. Great purchase! I love them!",LOVE!,5.0,B0002MCZR2
"...boots as Clarks always are. However, I was very disappointed in how wide they were at the top. This measurement is often given but not always correctly. These are much wider than I expected and I am bummed about it.",Comfortable...,4.0,B0002MCZR2
"I took an chance and purchased these online without having tried them on. I wear between a 11M-12M and decided to go with the 12M.  I couldn't be happier with my purchase! These boots fit like a dream! The toe box is roomy and rounded. The shaft is wide enough to fit regular jeans inside them, but not so wide that you can't cover the boot. I found the ankle a little baggy on me but my ankles are very slim for my size/height. I'm 5'10"" and the shaft hits about three inches below my knee. The sole itself is nicely padded inside and very flexible. The Moss colour looks like a rich chocolate brown, and the quality of the leather and the workmanship is superb.  I would highly recommend these boots!",Beautiful AND comfortable!,5.0,B0002MCZR2

"These boots are great!  I can wear them to work, as a kindergarten teacher, all day long without any discomfort.  However, I would recommend heading to your local carrier to try them for size.  I measure a 9 but can wear 9, 9.5, or 10 depending on the shoe.  I tried a 9 at the store and it was a little snug in the width; ordered a 9W and they fit like a glove.  They are snug enough that I can wear them under bootcut jeans and loose enough that I can wear legging underneath.  Overall, a great boot.","Finally, Comfortable Versatile Boots",5.0,B0002MCZR2

"This platform Clark's boot is stylish and very comfortable to walk in, even for me with my problem foot.  The toe bed is wide enough so that the toes are not cramped.  I like the low heel for extra height and it looks great tucked in my straight leg jean.  Initially, the boot is tight to zipper up over jeans but after a couple times the fit is perfect.  I highly recommend these boots if you want a trendy look but also are seeking comfort.",Clark's Gallery Etch Boots,5.0,B0002MCZR2
"First of all I wanted to get the $199 moss/brown variation in size 8 B(M), which is my typical size. To me, the picture of ""moss brown"" looked more brown than ""dark brown nubuck"". Long story short, in a moment of weakness, due to availability and a whopping $100+ discount, I ordered the 8.5 2A(N) in ""dark brown nubuck"", thinking at less than half price I'd just make them work. I consider my feet normal width so hoped I might be able to break them in. As for the half size up, sometimes in boots (especially Ariats) I can wear 8.5. I was very concerned about getting a reddish colored pair of boots though...

Well they arrived today, and I'm happy to report that the brown nubuck is a rich chocolate brown, just what I wanted. The two-tone colors of the boot remind me of a milk chocolate and dark chocolate color combo. The weird thing is, the 8.5Ns fit me perfectly. There's wiggle room in the toe area, which is fine, but the width does not feel narrow at all. I even had thick socks on. I don't know if this means an 8 would have felt wide, but just thought I'd share the information. They felt comfortable. I tried them on with thick leggings. They were snug in the calf but not suffocating. Zipper hardware is sturdy. Leather is beautiful... suede-like with darker leather accents. The boots felt well made and look expensive. The interior lining could have been nicer, but who cares. The heels are fashionably high, but not uncomfortably high. Wanted to get these first impressions recorded, but will report back on durability and long-term comfort as I experience it. Overall very happy!","Gorgeous boots, interesting sizing info...",5.0,B0002MCZR2

The boots have a gel bottom inside that is so comfortable, you don't feel like you are wearing a boot. The heal is not painfully noticeable.

"These boots are gorgeous! I ordered the Dark Brown Nubuck on a Lightning Deal and they have exceeded my expectations.

"I ordered two pairs of Grasshoppers in slightly different styles but the same size. The Janey fits true to size but these (Ashland) run small. Also, you can't really tell from the picture, but these actually look quite different than the Janey style. The opening is larger on the Ashland, so the top of the tongue sits lower on your foot, closer to your toes if that makes any sense. Not very attractive in my opinion.

"The length of the shoe seems pretty spot on, and the almond-shaped toe works well for me (my toes are dramatically angled biggest toe to smallest). However, for a narrow shoe they seem rather wide mid-arch to heel. Some heel grips will help, but it was a bit of a let down. To be fair however, I have very narrow feet and they are thin top to bottom, so I rarely fill out a shoe without wearing very heavy socks. For those with narrow heels and a wider forefoot, these might pinch in the toe box. Overall, these were a steal on sale at $17.99US, but I wouldn't have bought them for more than $25.00 considering I will have to add heel grips to them. The leather is very soft and pliant, and wouldn't be too heavy for summer weather.","Good, but very narrow feet should proceed with caution",4.0,B0002MB8DO

I simply love them. I love wearing them with my different color jeans, shorts and crop pants. They are really comfortable and I get a lot of compliments. I love things that are metallic and whimsical and I think these Keds are both. I love it that glitter has become a part of sportswear. It's just plain fun to wear tennis shoes that make a statement, are cute, and different as opposed to wearing the plain canvas ones. I am always looking for something different from the norm. The fit is great and I have actually worn them out shopping with no problem because they are so comfortable. I have worn Keds of some type for many many years.

"UPDATE:
These canvas double decker slip-on sneakers run small and are quite stiff. I tried both the black and navy pairs, and returned them.  If you buy the regular canvas slip ons, I suggest going 1/2 to 1 full size up and be prepared to break them in.

However, the jersey double decker slip-on sneakers (heather gray color, sold on a different page) run true to size and were so comfortable, with very little breaking-in time required.  If you buy the jersey slip ons, I suggest trying your normal size.

All of the double deckers I've tried on have more arch support than the similar-looking Keds ""crash back"" sneakers. I wore the jersey pair all night at a concert immediately after purchasing. The seams on the inside rubbed in a couple places (top of one foot, back of heels), but no blisters. Got a little sweaty in there, but I spy some Keds socks cut perfectly for these slip ons! I'll be careful to break them in properly - or more like build up a little more skin thickness in the achilles tendon area - before I expect them to go all day. Overall, they're just plain fun.

"When I was 18 or 19 (I am now 24) I bought my first pair of these, kind of on accident.  I had wanted another pair of moccasins in the store I was at, but they didn't have my size, so I settled for these.  Best thing that could have happened. Every year (maybe 14-16 months) since I have bought a pair of these shoes (because I run them into the ground.  Literally. The soles fall off, the leather gets holes.  Not because of bad craftsmanship either, I just wear them that much.)  They are so soft, so comfortable.  And I always get a size down because they STRETCH.  I usually wear 8/8.5, so I get a 7/7.5.  One year I got an 8 and within two weeks they had stretched super huge to where they flopped around on my foot.  My mistake though (and they were still super comfy).  The deerskin is so malleable and thin and soft that after they are broken in (takes about a day) it feels as if nothing is on your foot.

I wear these every day, everywhere, for everything, but they are not meant to be in water- not even the rain.  That doesn't stop me from doing it, just know that if they get wet they'll do what lightly-treated leather does and get kinda stiff.  Also, kind of a funny anecdote:  I was once camping and had my feet resting up on the edge of the fire ring and the glue holding the sole on melted and the sole started peeling off (so don't put these near flames...obvious to the non-oblivious).  I quickly slammed my foot back down onto the sandy ground where the glue instantly hardened back to the sole, though it was a little misshapen.  Still wore them for another 7 months.

"I usually wear a 10 1/2 wide women's shoe. Impossible to find. Also wear the 3/4 Vionic insert. I read the reviews, purchased this moccasin in the 10 regular and hoped for the best. These shoes are SO comfortable! Softness of the leather adjusted to the width and length of my foot without a problem. The insert also fits.

"This is the second pair of Demonia that I have purchased(one Ranger boot 300 the other these Platform sandals) & trust me they do not have the sizing right. The first pair(Ranger 300) I had to return for a size up. I ordered a size bigger for this pair too(Platform Sandal) & they fit in the length but I cannot walk in them without my toes sliding through the opening & therefore my toes have to cling on to the front to stay on but I cannot walk in the shoes this way. Instead of returning for a smaller size & having my heel hang over the back, I took to a local Shoe Dr. to take up the slack in the sides of the top flap that cover the top & sides of my foot. I hope this takes care of the problem because the shoes are so cute & I can't find platform sandals that don't look like a stripper. I'm not sure if I would order another pair considering the problems in sizing & the additional cost to fix the problem. I would rather pay a little more for a shoe that fits right but again the problem is finding this kind of look in a shoe is hard. I've searched & haven't had much success. I'm sure that is why I took the chance when ordering these after the first Demonia.",Cute but not functional,3.0,B0002PUX96

Scholl's foot pads to wear with them, and black socks (I know, I know- socks with sandals look stupid). The shoes would've been comfortable and would have fit perfect if I had gotten my actual size, but because they fit a bit big (being that I made the mistake and bought a half size bigger)- the shoes are a bit hard to walk in, as they feel like they could slip right off. Maybe if I gain weight, or hurt my foot to swell the shoes will fit better. I do recommend the shoes, just buy your right size.

"I really like the way these shoes look and slip on without much fuss. However, like another reviewer on here, I am slipping out of the shoe when I walk and have to grip with my toes just to walk in them. I usually am a size 7.5 but since there are no 1/2 sizes in this shoe, I ordered a size up because I often wear an 8 in flip-flops. Anyway, they are the exact right length for my foot so I can't exchange them for a 7. Some people stated that the strap seemed tight. I didn't find this at all. My feet seem long and narrow to me, but then I've also been told by an expert shoe-fitting machine that I have slightly wide feet, so who knows? I don't see any others like them that I would wear (I think I'm getting too old to wear a big star on the side of my shoe). I guess maybe I will take them to a shoe repair like the other reviewer did, but I'm not sure they're are worth the extra expense. I hope they last me a long time!

"I bought these shoes a long time ago and just recently started wearing them.  These have become my go-to shoes for summer.  At first I wasn't sure I liked them because they seemed kind of tight.  Yet, the upper piece did give and they are the most comfortable shoes ever.  I love the height that these shoes give without being awkward to walk in.  I find them very easy to walk in and balanced.  Additionally the comfort for me has been excellent.  I wear them to work where I have to do alot of city walking and they have been great.  I also have walked miles in them with no problem.  I know it sounds funny, since they are pretty high up, but the cross between the balance and the comfort makes them very easy.  I like just being able to slip into them without having to find matching socks or fussing with a lace or zipper.  I have had no problems as far as slipping goes - they seem to grip the ground great (the little pattern on the bottom is very cute too).  Driving is no problem.  I really like these.  My only gripe is that they are starting to show slight signs of wear and I do tend to get a little whitish film on them from time to time due to the bacteria that collects on feet.  If you purchase these and find them a little tight at first, please give them a chance.  My experience with Pleaser shoes and these is that they will grow into your foot shape.

Great for wearing without socks. They keep your feet warm and dry but are not overly hot. Some other reviews I read said that they ran small, but I ordered a size 9 (I usually wear an 8 or 9 depending on the shoe) and they fit perfectly! I decided on the abigail style because I have large-ish calves and was worried about being able to get the boot on. This style is also great because I can easily tuck my boot cut jeans into it (I am not one of the privileged few who look good in skinny jeans). The sole is sturdier than it looks in the pictures. As for traction, this style doesn't look like it would be that safe to wear on icy days, but I haven't tried it out yet. Probably better for going to the mall than shoveling your driveway.

On the top of the shoe that goes to where your foot starts to show kept digging into my foot. Everyday, my feet would be very swollen and sore. I had to were these shoes every day, 6 hours a day, for a week. Then, I had to wear them in our 4 performances. As soon as I would get off stage, I would just stop and rip them off quick!

"I ordered one half size up as suggested, they were a little big in the back, but once your feet swell from dancing, isn't that what you want? I took these puppies literally straight out of the box right up on stage for a 3 hour dance rehearsal. I could not have been happier with how they held up without being properly broken in. The most ingenious part of these is actually the little notch taken out of the back of the shoe that would usually hit your heel. Why every shoe in the world hasn't done this yet is beyond me because it eliminates the rubbing and bleeding and blistering of the heel which is so common in too stiff shoes. At the end of the night my feet were a little sore, but NOTHING compared to what I was expecting, they're actually rather comfortable. The fuzzy coating on the inside of the shoes will make your feet sweat a little so just be aware of that. I love how low the heel is on this so no teetering issues.

"The shoes arrived very quickly which was amazing because I live in a small town in France!
The colour is great, like many people have said the strap has tiny holes which is a bit frustrating to buckle up but then again you won't spend your evening doing that hopeully.

However, the sizing was totally off- chalk it up to North American vs European conversion: I ordered a US 11 (half up from my usual street shoes) (euro 41 = anywhere between 10 and 11 apparently) and it was way too big!

The quality is nothing to write home about, they seem comfortable, but they feel a bit flimsy and you can see how cheap the material is around the seams on the heel, but for the listed price it's pretty good. I only recommend it if you can return them cheaply and easily

Unfortunately I took a gamble by ordering these overseas.

"I paid attention to the reviews to get an idea of the right size to buy, but, unless there is inconsistency in the manufacturing, I can only conclude that customers just expect ballet shoes to fit differently than they actually do.  I ordered my normal shoe size and they fit perfectly.  I tightened the elastic and retied it to customize the fit.  I also read concerns about no difference between right and left -- but there aren't supposed to be -- you can either alternate to enhance the longevity of the shoe (they wear more on the big toe side), or wear them consistently to get a nice custom fit.

"Got this boots for my wife, those boots are actually a rebranded Demonia 815 style. Due to the nature of the boots, they are very heavy. The quality is not the best, and boots are not real leather, but it has killer looks. Boots are back-zip. Very easry to put them on

-Pros
Cheap.
Not leather (if you are into ""dont kill the animals"")
Awesome looks.
Not as heavy as real leather, but still heavy.

Cons:
a little too tight. might not be a good idea to put them with jeans, the zipper might break.
Zipper might not last long. if you have used New Rock boots you will be disappointed with the back zipper.

"I decided to go through all my shoes and writes reviews for them...so hope I help!

I've worn and loved these for around 4/5 years..they're sturdy as all-get-out. The straps on the front allow me to make sure they fit snug around my leg/ ankle which is a HUGE plus and the only reason I was actually able to buy these...Adult shoes companies do not make shoes in my size so if I want something like this I HAVE to have straps or laces. They feel great for a platform, they're one of the more comfortable of all the Demonia's I own.

After reading another review (the 2 star)...I was confused as to WTF the person was saying about falling off/or out of them...because I've never fell once. (unlike several of the other Demonia's I have.)
I should be a prime candidate to fall in these, I actually wear a size 2/3 shoe..but the pair I have in these are a size 6, I'm super clumsy, I'm a heavy drinker and I go dancing..not to mention I live in the south and most bar parking lots are gravel where I am!

The only thing I can think of they could have been referring to is the bottoms falling through.. after 4/5 years I've not had this issue. They're still as sturdy as ever. The bottoms are SOLID after-all, it's not like they're hollow. They also don't get heavy because the material is still light weight. I've worn them in rain and snow and after a good cleaning you'd never known they'd been worn. They're not ""soft"" or ""floppy"" at all. They're a nice solid shoe..yet still the material the bottoms are made of still are easy on the feet for the most part. =)

They do fit like a second skin, (if you want them too, they ARE adujustable to fit the ankle/leg) your foot doesn't move around or anything...so unless you just have bad luck or get outrageously fit-saced you're not going to fall down..and even then it's not because of the shoe it's because you're out of it. LOL

I'm pretty sure that poster was one of those stupid paid reviewers trying to get you to buy that other brand I've never heard of...So, I'd really just disregard that entire post. It seems they just looked at the shoe and wrote what they ""thought"" might happen in such a shoe.

I think you'll all be just fine in them. =)  My best friend has a pair she bought after seeing mine about 4 years ago, and she feels the same as I do about these. =)

These will draw alot of attention, and compliments..so if you're antisocial it's a bit annoying at times. =P",5 Year and Still Loving them!,5.0,B0002UU36E

"Most complaints address issues concerning the larger calf, and I am on the far opposite side of the spectrum. My legs are narrow and a mile long, so I spent about thirty minutes adjusting the buckle straps to my fitting. All in vain, of course. 'Cause in between my calf and ankle formed an akward bubble-- where my calf was SUPPOSED  to be. This, however, can't be too intolerable, after paying that much for them. As for the feet themselves, I did get a size six, and they fit like a glove. So it'd probably be a good idea to either get a size up, or take your exact measurements. They're hard and plastic-y; they'd be real painful in a smaller size.

No one's brought this up yet, but for my detail-oriented fellows, note that you must NOT bump the platforms together or up against something else. They scuff and scar VERY easily, and that's a lot of blank surface to blemish.

The tongues of the boots shift around a lot when you put them on, so like lacing up a corset, make sure the flaps are in check as you proceed, otherwise you'll be mighty uncomfortable. I'm about to pin them in place just so I don't have to worry about that as much.

If you're a stickler for symmetry, the buckles might bother you a bit if you intend on adjusting them to your width. BOTH SIDES OF THE BUCKLES ADJUST, so you can fix this. It'll take a lot of trial and error though.

Also, they're very heavy. I am, however, new to platform boots and I don't wear big heels very often, so it caught me off guard and I almost died a very horrible death.

Aside, I'm taken by the beautiful glossiness and the creative use of space. There's so much to feel and look at, they're a perfect companion for the easily entertained. I am pleased with my purchase.",Not exactly what I was expecting!,4.0,B0002UU36E

"only reason i'm giving these 4 stars instead of 5 is because there was A NAIL in my boots! luckily i noticed it while i was doing the buckles, otherwise it would have hurt me. it was SHARP. seriously, why was there a nail in my boots?? if i had put them on without removing it i would have cut my leg on it! i guess, be careful for random nails in your boots if you buy these!! it was pushed all the way in, i pulled it out a little so i could take a picture which i included with this review.

anyway, aside from the extreme hazard of a sharp nail being in them, they're pretty great. my feet and calves feel so protected, as if i'm wearing armor. i went with polyurethane instead of the more shiny leather option because polyurethane breathes better and i don't have clothes that go with super shiny boots. they look slightly more casual without the shine imo but everyone else still gasps and when they see me wearing them, haha.

they're surprisingly easy to walk in! i've never worn platform shoes before, and i've only worn heels once in my entire life. it's awkward at first getting used to the weight and not knowing exactly where the bottom of your boot is (since theres 5 inches between you and the ground), and getting used to the excess leather from the buckles brushing against each other as you walk. i would have to waddle like a penguin if i wanted to avoid them touching, lol. they are a little heavy but that's probably just because i'm not used to wearing boots in general, tbh. actually, these are A LOT easier to walk in than my snow boots and the weight is easier to handle. i mean, they're no substitute for snow boots, but they fit better than my snow boots do. of course that's not really relevant because no one knows what my snow boots even are, but i digress.

i wear a size 9 and so i got a 9, but i can see why other reviews say to go a size up. i have to wear thin socks or they're hard to zip, BUT this is with all the buckles being as tight as possible so i could probably just adjust them if i wanted to wear thick socks. so far i've been wearing thigh high socks with them. they're snug but i like them that way, i could easily loosen the bottom buckles if i needed more room.

"I love these boots and bought them to be my comfy every day boots. But while the foot of these boots fit great the legs didn't fit the calf shaping started 1"" lower than my own and cut in so badly at the top it hurt( even with the elastic built in).

"I purchased this pair of boots after reading the couple of reviews here.  I am typically a size 10, and decided to go with size 10 since I have purchased Pleasers before in this size with no problems.

Well, when I received them, they looked fantastic and were going to replace another pair of boots.  When I tried them on, my foot fit perfectly, but as I started to zip, I realized they were going to be too tight in the calves!  I was trying them on barefoot, no pantyhose or leggings, and they were impossibly too tight there.  I was shocked, since I have never had this problem with boots, and since I loved these so much, I decided to keep them and try to make it work with Shoe Stretch.  I don't think it worked, since I wasn't able to zip them up to even try stretching them out.

I fully expecting them to be loose in the calves, as a review here suggested, but they must be sized pretty irregularly, or my calves are just too big for these.  This would make sense, except that I own several pairs of boots and have recently bought more, and never have this issue.  One thing about them that I noticed is the stretchy adjustment triangle strip near the zipper is shorter than on other pairs of boots, so they only start stretching far up.  Nevertheless, I've decided to try some compression pantyhose and the Shoe Stretch again - if I manage to squeeze into them, I'll just wear them until they break in.  In any case, it's a lot of headache to go through for a pair of boots!

Anyway, my recommendation is, if you like the look of these shoes, try them on in the store or be prepared to possibly return them.",Look amazing but tight in the calves!,3.0,B0002UTZGS
"These boots are cool looking. My only complaint about these boots is they are super tight around the ankle. I am fairly slender with skinny ankles, if anything I usually have problems with boots being too big - however I have to wear a thick pair of wool socks with these boots so they don't rub on my ankles when I dance or walk. I'd hoped wearing the thick socks would stretch them eventually but no dice - they are cut too tight. I imagine they'd be very uncomfortable for girls with largish ankles or lower legs.",Stylish - But tight on the ankles,2.0,B0002UTZGS

CON:  Received color Taupe shoes instead of Tan that I ordered (including replacement pair).
The box they come in is a little too small so it's squeezed into the box.
It was mailed in a plastic mailer bag instead of cardboard box so had to return first pair which was wrinkled.

"I know platform boots of this style look intimidating but they're surprisingly comfortable to wear.  I wear mine all day long.  Pleaser brand has never let me down.  They're a true-to-size fit, affordable, and are quality boots.  The only bad thing I'd say is that the shaft width is too small.  If a person has muscular or fatter calves the boots won't fit.  Most seem to only give a 13-14 inch diameter.  Larger women like me would fare better with a 17 inch opening but even with the laces spread they won't fit.  Especially buckled boots, I've returned many adorable boots with buckles on account of my larger calves.

That's my only negative statement, I wish Pleaser would make the Electra foot style with larger calves.  This particular model is the only one that fits because it's shorter in height.

I also was sort of expecting them to be super tight at the thigh. I have rather full muscular thighs and smaller calves, but they actually are awesomely snug!

Takes forever to put on (full lace-up + 3 buckles that have several loopholes) but they're gorgeous and pretty comfortable and due to their snugness, you don't have to worry too much about the discomfort of walking on 5"" stilettos since you get all the ankle support you need.

"These boots have an immediate ""wow!"" effect with their height, length, and style. Because of the platform, the heel doesn't even feel so high, which means walking in them is not so difficult.
HOWEVER, you can't really bend your knees much (almost not at all), and if you have anything other than average to skinny thighs, they might not close properly at the top, even with the most possible slack given.","Amazing look, but probably not for everyone",5.0,B0002Z1LTW
"I rode the Electra 3028 thigh-high boot some eight miles on a bicycle, and they are solid! I thought surely the chunk heel would come off after grinding pavement in city street traffic, but only the thick rubber soles were gouged or nicked at ride end. Btw, I live in a city where theatrics, like wearing sexy red boots, is all a part of keeping it weird. Now, I have a narrow, size 9, men's foot (4 inches at the widest) and bought the size 11 women's boot; it's very, VERY snug. (Do women really torture their feet in this way to be attractive?) My biker leg fit fine (calf size 13.5 inches); the pinch really comes at the ankle and toes. Where I was surprised it did not pinch was at the knee; I rode rather comfortably without restriction of motion. As for the design of the Electra 3028, its truly rebellous - from the buckles to the zipper to the amazingly-crafted chunk heel. Red and black laces both come with the product. If you wear these boots in the outdoors and are exerting yourself like bicycling or chopping wood, then I definitly recommend weather in the 20s to the 30s because these boots are not only hot, but temperature-hot!

"First off, as a guy size 12 man, I bought the size 14 woman.  This is for a Halloween Costume party.  This should be a good shocker to my friends.  I love having the lace in the front due to my thick legs.  This allowed me to lace it to where i could use just the side zippers and not have it too tight.  Looks sexy and is going to be the highlight of this party.  If any other men are looking into this boot, the 3 side belt straps might become to short to wrap around depending on your leg thickness.

I've got some chunky ol' thighs, but with this boot you can loosen the laces to conform to whatever size your legs are. I'm 5'4 and they went about half way up my thigh.

"Love this boot!!! I am sure it fits to size. I am really a 9 1/2 but did not want to go too small in the foot area. The 10 works well. It is a beautiful boot and nice and showy for pole work. It takes a bit more work because it is heavier and for those who love inverts, the boot sticks amazingly well to the pole (maybe a little too well). I do slide out of the boot a little when my invert has both legs on the pole. Or, I should say, the boot sticks to the pole so well that the top portion slides down to my knee when a grip involves my knees on the pole inverted. I hope that makes sense.

The only reason it gets 4 instead of 5 stars is that after walking a while, I had a lot of pain in my ankles and a blister or two. Because of their material and style, they don't bend well at the ankle and the heel (not the height, but the part that the back of your foot rests against) is very rigid.

"I have had so much fun with these boots.  I've used them now for 3 different costumes, and I've gotten comments on them everytime.  The shoe portion fits fine - what seems small is the calf.  If you have wide calves like I do, then be prepared to give up at least 15 minutes per boot to fit properly.  You don't want to pull too hard, but you will have to pull and move, pull and move because if you do it too quickly, the tongue will scoot and you will have peeps of skin poking out.  I could do without the zipper....I thought that would help by not having to lace them every time, but once you undo the zipper, the laces come undone as well.

"I posted the following review of All Out Bolds at Merrell.  This was my second pair because I love them so much:

I have been looking for a shoe that could take me from the campground to being a tourist in town to shorter hikes while traveling. I found it with the Merrell All Out Bold. My shoes arrived yesterday, and I immediately took out on a 5 mile hike to see if they were going to work. No break-in needed  comfortable from the first step, and I love how they look. I was really worried how the strap was going to work because I have a really high arch so was concerned it would be too binding, but its stretchable without giving too much. I wore no socks  no blisters. These shoes are a perfect blend of utilitarian in the outdoors and yet also perfect later for trips into town. I often get up early for a quick hike/walk with our dog before everyone else is up, and its great to find a slip-on for quick take offs first thing in the morning. Ill still take my Merrell Moabs for more rigorous, rocky, unstable trails, but its going to be great taking only two pairs of shoes on my trips to meet all my needs  the Merrell All Out Bolds and the Moabs.

"These are probably some of the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn. I had started taking my dog on longer walks and my usual go-to, Tom's, weren't working for me anymore. My feet were hurting like crazy.

I spent the a bunch of time looking for simple slip-on walking shoes and ended up on these. The back of the heel wore on my ankle the first 3 days I wore them, but since then it has been perfect. They aren't the most supportive shoes ever, but for their style I think they're plenty supportive. I wouldn't recommend rock climbing with them or anything, but for walking around the neighborhood and very simple hikes, they're great.

"I received these shoes yesterday morning early. I put them on and wore them all day, including two long walks with the dog in the park. Today I put them on first thing, and have already worn them for two more long walks. I am a perfect size 7 medium, and these shoes are true to size, but there is no extra room in them. I am wearing them barefoot, as there is no room even for thin socks. The rounded toe box is wide enough , and very comfortable, but there is no extra length whatsoever. I don't need arch support, and don't think these shoes supply that anyway, so it isn't an issue for me. These shoes have been very comfortable straight out of the box--no break in period needed--and no rubs or bumps on my feet this morning. They look cute on...I am wearing them with jeans, and plan to wear them with a very casual skirt  for shopping and errands. They are very lightweight, and the soles give good traction on grass, gravel, and pavement.

These have quickly become a staple of my daily wardrobe, and in fact I am about to purchase another pair (I've worn the pair I have all summer).  They are comfortable for wearing all day (and I do a lot of walking).  The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because I did not find there to be much arch support.  However, I was able to add drugstore inserts, which solved the problem.  Some reviewers have said that there is not enough space for inserts, since the strap is not adjustable.  I did not have that problem with my inserts, but I guess every foot is different.

"I fell in love with these shoes because they are edgy and uncommon.

1. The shipping was fast. I recieved an e-mail the day after I ordered them that they have been shipped and received them 4 days later.

2. They are very lightweight. I expected them to be heavy. You can fold the top half down to make room in closet or when carrying them around.

3. If you are blessed with having muscular calves as I do, they can be a bit of a pain to get on as any knee-high boot would. You WILL have to untie and loosen the laces and undo 3 of the 4 latches to get them on and zipped up all the way. The tongue needs to held in place with a free hand while zipping the closure.

4. The platform and heel make a sturdy base so you can strut your stuff with confidence, but I'd still be extrra careful when dealing with stairs or driving a car. The platform is a little over 2 inches and may throw you off when climbing stairs or driving.

5. They look great with a skirt that shows them in all their glory, or you can wear them with jeans so make them your little ""cool"" secret.

The only complaint that I have is that I wear a size 9.5 shoe, and wound up having to buy a size ELEVEN in this boot to fit my foot.  I've been wearing Demonia boots for years and don't remember having this issue before...but BE WARNED!!!  Buy a FULL SIZE bigger than you need!!!","Great boots, but run REALLY small",4.0,B0002UU1OS
"I love, love, LOVE these boots!!! I needed new heeled knee-high boots because my previous pair finally committed shoe suicide. The previous pair I owned were the Demonia Gothika 209, and they cracked at the arch (past the point of no return). I really like these boots (the Slush 225) much better! They fit like a glove. I took the advice of the comments and ordered a size up. I'm glad I did! If I hadn't, there would have been NO WAY these boots would have fit. They are a little snug in the toe area, but I think once they are broken in they may fit a little better. The buckles and laces really give you a perfect fit for your ankles and calves. I have relatively thin ankles, so my previous boots (Gothika 209) never fit right around the ankles... it was always a bit baggy and looked a little strange. The Slush 225 boots are MUCH better! There isn't any bagginess around the ankles at all.

I was a little worried about the height (going from a 3 3/4 heel to a 4 1/2) but they are really easy to walk in and surprisingly comfortable! I also added a padded insole, as I do with all my boots. I've literally worn these for four days straight, one day for over 12 hours PLUS to a concert (standing room only), and at the end of the night I only felt mild discomfort in the toe area (again, from being snug around the toes). No blisters or sore feet here! On the other hand, the Gothika 209 boots were murder to walk in more than a few hours, let alone several days straight.

I also really like that these boots have a slimmer toe. My previous boots had a rather wide toe, and I always had to wear double socks with an insole so my foot wouldn't slide around in them. With these boots, I don't have that problem at all. They really do fit like a second skin. Because of the slim fit, they look great under jeans, too. I definitely recommend!",New favorite boots: FOUND!,5.0,B0002UU1OS
"I bought these for my girlfriend, and she loved them! I ordered her a size up, because I saw they ran small, and they fit her just right. She said they are pretty comfortable, and easy to walk in. The only thing she found wrong with these boots was that the insole has came loose, after only wearing them twice. Granted that is an easy thing to fix, but you would think that for the price they could put in better insoles.",Awesome boots but.....,4.0,B0002UU1OS
"These are quite literally the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn in my life! It's a bonus that they're wickedly sexy!

The platform is at an appropriate height so that it's very easy to walk. I believe the heel is a little more than four inches, the platform about two inches, so really it feels as if you're walking on a two-inch heel rather than a four-inch heel.

The inside of the shoe was more comfortable than I expected and even hoped. It felt like walking on little foot clouds!

I'm terribly fortunate that I have small feet, since previous reviewers remarked how the sizes ran a little small. I got a size 8, since I'm approximately a 7 or 7-1/2, so these were a perfect fit with a tiny bit of room to spare.

I'm terribly happy how adjustable these shoes are. You can adjust them with both the laces and the buckles. Having tiny ankles, the laces and buckles came in handy when I was fitting the shoe to my leg.

The last thing I'd like to comment on is that the shoes had better traction than I expected. I also love that despite their appearance, they aren't heavy at all. Not that they feel cheap - they don't. They feel like what you paid for them!

In short, the boots are perfect. I'm a model, operatic singer, cosplayer, recording artist and an aspiring stage performer, so these suit all of the purposes I can possibly think of. These will be perfect for anything from a hot date to performing onstage to photoshoots to cosplay.

I would recommend these to anyone who like tall, sexy, wicked, incredibly comfortable, edgy shoes. My best suggestion would be to order a size up from your normal shoe size so you'll not have to deal with the issue of them being too tight.",Perfectly and Amazingly Wicked!,5.0,B0002UU1OS

"My husband has worn these shoes for decades.  He was disappointed, to say the least, when he found that the manufacturer had changed, and so had the shoe fit/size, construction, and some aspects of the style.  He had already removed the insoles and put orthopedic insoles in (as he has again, been doing for several years), having NO reason that the fit would have changed from the last several shoes of this exact size and style he has ordered and worn.  We therefore could not return them, and donated them to a local charity. We will not be ordering them again.","He was disappointed, to say the least",1.0,B0000ESTEA

Also, they are almost so mallible and thin that they are uncomfortable. The material is so soft you have to constantly make sure nothing scrapes or snags on it. I have to admit I was a little disappointed because the other styles I have purchased from Minnetonka have held up so much better, and these deer skin slip ons were significantly more expensive.

"I did some research on shoes before purchasing these and these came up on several lists. The price was right, as I checked several places and could not find any as low as Amazon offered. So, my decision to order was made--especially after reading the reviews also.
The shoes are comfortable, support my flat feet very well and my ankles. I can walk for hours in them with no problem, but I need to wear socks. One day I slipped them on without socks and ended up with a blister on one toe.
Color is great although I would have preferred something brighter. But it's a nice neutral color and has a reflective triangle on the back for runners.
I normally wear a 10 but bought a 10.5 to allow for wear of socks in winter and not be too tight. Very comfortable fit.",Great supportive walking shoes,4.0,B0000DZA4T

"I owned a part of these shoes and they had lasted years.  It has a wide heel base, a stabilizing feature. It was time to get a new pair.  These were about $30 less than the last pair which I purchased in a shoe store.  And. . . I was able to get the new pair in grey with purple trim which I like very much.  They arrived faster than expected.",A solid athletic shoe,5.0,B0000DZA4T
"I probably ordered them in the wrong size. I have wide feet and so got a wide width version and they were too wide. I thought I could manage them but the longer I've had them the wider they've gotten. Yes there was no break in time or anything and yes they're comfy, but I feel like I have to clench my toes to get some grip in them so that my feet aren't sliding around in them whilst I run on the treadmill. It's not the shoes fault, it's my fault.

Also, I'm not sure of the stretchy fabric upper situation. My previous running shoes were Nike's which felt as though there was a lot more upper foot support in them. Again this might be a function of the width issues I have with these shoes. Another important note is that these shoes are quite heavy (especially coming from my previous Nike ones); you do get used to them but if you travel a bit and want to take them along for your workouts, they are not light in your luggage. I'm not sure when it's time to replace them (probably in the next couple of months when they'll be about a year old), I'd get the same pair. I would have loved to have tried them in a medium (B) width but I didn't enjoy them enough to risk going with the same shoe/brand again. Next time I might try out New Balance or Asics or Brooks.

On the positive, I have really big feet and most sneakers look like boats on my feet. These on the other hand made my feet look small and dainty and I felt comfortable wearing them with shorter jogging bottoms as opposed to my usual shoe-skimming sweatpants.

I'm giving these shoes 4 stars because there was no break in time, they never made my feet hurt and they were comfy and attractive for workout shoes. The loss in star is not because of the size issue (I take the blame for that even though I think these shoes may possibly run wide), its because I don't feel like even in a regular width, the stretchy fabric would offer much foot support compared to the weight of the sole. And yes, these are NOT light shoes.",I like them BUT...,4.0,B0000DZA4T

"I had been racing in the Fastwitch 4 and planned to move into the 5, but instead I ordered this pair of the 4 after reading many negative reviews about the 5. (Thank you, random reviewer out in Web land who shared in her review that she found 4's on Amazon.) I actually enjoy putting these shoes on when I get to the run in a triathlon even if I'm not excited about the actual run at that point. They are so light, and when I was training with heavier shoes, putting these on was like putting on slippers. I'm now training in Saucony's Kinvara 2 -- also extremely light -- so I don't notice the light weight of these as much anymore and could probably race in my training shoes, but where would the fun and excitement be in that? When I put these on, I know it's time to run, and even with an assortment of my own physical issues and imbalances, these shoes carry me fluidly through races.

The reasons for 4 stars, instead of 5... First, they wear EXTREMELY quickly, which I know is common for racing shoes, but these seem to have worn more quickly. But I did choose to buy this second pair of them because I really do love them. Second, because they're so thin, I can feel small rocks through them, and at times a small rock gets wedged between the treads, and on the rare occasion that a rock doesn't fall out -- b/c I feel that rock with every stride -- I have had to stop to remove it. As I said, though, it's a rare situation.

It was worth paying a little more for an older model to get a shoe I know works for me -- and gives Saucony some time to revisit this model and find something closer to it for the inevitable Fastwitch 6.",Loving Saucony,4.0,B0000E07KZ

They are very cute...I loved the look immediately (and bought some for my son).

However, after two days at Disney (prior to the Marathon), my feet were killing me!  I put in a pair of orthotics...it may just be that my feet are used to heels and running shoes for stability, and these are just a little too flat and too unstructured for me...and that was perfect.

I have now worn these boots a number of times to break them in and soften the tongue so it molds better to my ankle. There are real pluses to the boot.

"The item arrived quickly, exactly as ordered. Unfortunately, the shoe runs large. The 6S fits like a 6 1/2 B. Since the shoe was inexpensive, on sale, it's not worth returning. This is apparently a manufacturer's sizing problem. Finding a true 6S has become almost impossible from any manufacturer, at any cost, from any supplier: store or online. This is an attractive shoe, seems well constructed, and would be comfortable, I'm sure, if it fit. If you have a very narrow foot, I would not recommend this item.",Westwind,1.0,B0002LYO90

"I have always like Grasshopper shoes and was pleased to see Amazon had a pair that would suit my needs. They arrived promptly, but sad to say, they were the wrong size.

These grasshopper shoes are one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn.  The sole of the shoe is cushiony and you almost feel like you are walking on air.  I was a bit concerned about the light color (they only had beige available at the time of purchase).  There was a little bit of dirt on the shoes and it wiped them off lightly with some warm water. I would definitely recommend these shoes especially for summer and the warmer months.,comfortable slip-ons,5.0,B0002LYO90

"I love these boots, they are beautiful. I got the last 9.5 pair, there were so few of this style left. I usually wear size 9 but with the heal a little taller these give me more room for my toes. The larger boot top/opening will accommodate the kind of skinny jeans a 57 year old woman would wear so I'm very happy with that.

"A comfortable boot for having a slight heel. I don't wear heels, and these (though low) are about as comfortable as heels can be. Makes them a bit dressy without being uncomfortably high. Boots are very stylish and go well w/ skirts, pants or jeans. There is some padding in the shaft of the boot which is nice. I've had other boots without that and as the boot creases it dents into my shins/ankles. These are more comfortable. I have a very small calf and they are slightly roomy - leaving room for jeans to be tucked in if I wanted to, but not too wide to be floppy without tucking. The footbed is pretty well padded, but I would have given it 5 stars for just a little more padding. All in all seem to be well made and comfortable.",Comfy for a heeled boot,4.0,B0002MCZR2

The zippers (there are two on each boot, only one that you actually use to get them on and off) make a bit of a clinking noise, but I would say that boots usually aren't super quiet when you walk.

However, the bad part is the shaft of the boot.  The length of the shaft was too long for me and also was tight.  For taller people, this probably won't be a problem.

"My ankle measures 9.5""
My calves at their widest point are 14""
I wear a true women's US size 9M
I'm 5'7"" in case that helps give you a sense of my leg length.

I ordered these in a 9 despite other reviews stating there was a sizing issue. Here's what I found upon trying them on.

The length of the footbed is indeed true to size. The width is also consistent with a 9M. There was plenty of room for my ankles. But as other reviewers have stated, it was VERY tight in the calves. And I have rather thin calves for a person my height. What is going on with the shaft is that they ""shaped"" it into an S-curve. Most women's calves form a gentle slope into the ankle. If my legs were as skinny as my ankle up to the calf muscle, then the shaft would fit perfectly. As it is, I have normal legs, and I could barely get the zipper up. It was physically challenging to get that blasted zipper up.
The top of the shaft hits me right below the knee, and I mean right there below my knee, so if I bend my leg the back of the shaft jabs me in the back'o'the knee crease. Take note, any girls who may be shorter than me.

The boot seems sewn together decently well. The material is cheap costume material but that seems to be the best you can get in alternative styles. Why? Beats me. I'd happily pay more for a good boot in this style. The zipper held up to the 150,000 lbs of torque I had to apply to get the thing up. I was expecting it to burst at the seams any second but it didn't. That's a good sign I suppose.

The sole is heavy. Don't let other reviewers fool you. You will be hefting weight around if you can fit your calves into these boots. I was a bit disappointed in the sole material. I was really hoping for a cushier foam or rubber that would make it light and make me feel like I was floating on gothic clouds. Sadly it's a hokey plastic that, I might add, was a bit slippery. And all I did was traipse around the house on my wood floors a bit. I'd probably expect to fall on my tookus if I encountered a truly slippery surface.

All in all, it's a fun looking boot. It fits the foot well. Super skinny legs are a must. If you do have skinny legs, expect them to get bulkier with muscles lugging the weight of the boots around, which might be the boot's way of telling you, ""Haha. You fit? Not for long!"" I really don't think these boots really want to fit anyone. Don't expect these to come to your rescue if you run across anything slippery.",I Wish They Were Better,3.0,B0002UTZGS

"Although Amazon didn't have my size, I found this shoe at a local dance store and I'm so glad I did!

I was originally hesitant to buy an open-toe shoe for fear of my toes slipping forward, but these are great dance shoes. They allow for a sexy open-toe look, but the T-strap holds the shoe up and, with the higher sides, doesn't allow for your toes to slide forward and out of the shoe. The highest point of the toe opening is around 1.5 inches, and allowed half of my big toe to show (descending, of course, from there on down to my last two toes, which can't be seen at all). The heel is a perfect height for me, just shy of 2.75 inches. The color is a flat black, no shine or bling. But I'm planning on making a few removable fabric ""sleeves"" for the t-strap, one with rhinestones, one with pearls, etc. The only other thing I added was that I cut a piece of moleskin padding (with the adhesive backing) and put it in the shoe on the edge of the toe opening, in the curve next to my big toe. I believe that effectively stopped the shoe from cutting into my toe and provided a little more help in holding back my foot. I've worn them ballroom dancing for 2 times now, 3 hours each time and no problems. In street shoes I wear a 9, these are a 9.5.

I ordered a size 7 and the arch fits perfect for both my feet.  My left foot is 1/2 a size smaller then my right, so the fact that the arch is perfect for both is amazing.  The reason I gave them two stars is for the toe part of the boot.  It is so narrow, and I have super skinny narrow feet, that it squishes my toes and then my feet start to hurt immensely.  I had to take my boots off half way through my con because the pain was so bad.  Then I couldn't walk the rest of the weekend so I had to change to a different cosplay for the rest of the con.

Ordered these on the recommendation of my best friend.  She has been wearing hers for about 8 years and loved them!  They were a little tight but I have a wide foot. It didn't take long for them to stretch.  I wear them about 16 hours a day.  They have to be the most comfortable sandals I have ever owned!  I'm thinking about ordering another pair just to have a spare.,Love these!,5.0,B0006OC8H8
"The shoe looked great, but didn't fit at all.  I ordered a size 7.  The strap was so tight that I could barely get my foot into it.  Was gonna give them to my mom, who usually wears a smaller size than myself, but she said the same thing.  So I exchanged them for an 8.  The same deal all over again.  Wasted time was all this shoe gave me.  I have a pair of Columbia flip flips already, had them for about 13-14 years. They wear well and would still be in good shape but my puppy got them. I just wanted some that looked newer.  Columbia has good shoes, just not this particular one.","Great looking shoe, but bad fit.",1.0,B0006OC8H8
I purchased these sandals hoping for comfortable walking around the cruise ship on my last cruise. These are the most comfortable sandals I have ever owned.

"After purchasing a very similar pair of Columbia sandals approximately 8 years ago (which, by the way, are still very much wearable, but, due to excessive wear, not really appropriate for work), I had been looking for a new pair for about 3 years. When I found these, I immediately ordered them.

They actually fit a little more snugly than my older pair,but in no way is it uncomfortable. In comparing them, my older pair is visibly a little wider. I know they will last many years, like my other ones. I now have a nice pair for work, and, to save my nice pair, immediately change into my older pair when I get home.

I definitely recommend these to anyone who wants comfort in a nice looking casual sandal. Definitely worth the money.",Most comfortable sandals EVER!,5.0,B0006OC8H8
"I bought a pair of tango flips about 8 years ago and LOVED them!  They were super comfortable, had great arch support, and were very durable.  When they finally started falling apart it had been so long that I couldn't find them in stores anymore.  I was so attached to my pair that I held them together with a band-aid when they finally started splitting.  Wonder of wonders! I finally found some on Amazon.  The reason I gave them 4 stars is that you have to break them in.  The top leather portion may need to stretch a bit to fit your foot (this happened with my original pair too), but once it's broken in they are amazing.  The fit is true otherwise, so if you're a 10 get a 10.",My favorite flipflops EVER!,4.0,B0006OC8H8

"Ordered these as part of a costume for a convention. Ordered a size up as recommended and although the calves are still snug, my feet are constantly slipping and sliding while I walk. One of the back heel parts dig in(as if it wasn't sewn correctly or cut too big), so I constantly get blisters with them. After wrapping that up in a roll of gauze, it's bearable and not totally killing my feet. At the end of the first whole day wearing them(7am-late into the night) I noticed the sole was coming off. If I could order a size 8 to replace this pair, I would. But only 11 and 9 are available and its been that way for the last coupe months. If you get these, don't put your feet together.

These are supposed to be narrow and the toe area is so wide it would be comical if I didn't have to send back multiple pairs of these shoes.

"These slippers were horrible, I ordered them for my husband, he put them on and walked around the house for about 5 minutes. The soles were very hard and non-flexible. They also caused pain on the outside of his foot near his little toe. We promptly returned them.

I work in a power plant and am on my feet all day long.  These boots are so comfortable I'm thinking about buying another pair just to have for good.  The arch support is awesome.

"These are great looking and so comfortable.  The leather looks really nice with a casual outfit or something more dressy.  I bought some Yellow Box flip flops a few years ago, and was hooked because of their comfort.  They are more comfortable than the LL Bean ones I had been wearing.  I'm one of those people who has trouble with getting blisters or rub marks between my toes when I wear thong flip flops, but I have never had that problem with this brand.",Love Yellow Box!,5.0,B0006UC412

"In five years of climbing (indoors) I have tried at least six styles/brands of climbing shoes. I like these best. They are a little more aggressive than the women's lace-up Miura, which I loved before discovering the Testarossa. My last pair of Testarossas latest nearly two years of 3x week indoor climbing. They are a great all-around shoe for small edges, toeing into small holds, overhangs, and smearing. I only wish they were velcro, but then they probably wouldn't fit as well. I describe them as little tiny corsets for my feet. : )",Great all-around shoe that holds up well,4.0,B0002XLE2I

"To start, these shoes were so ridiculously tight on my toes that I couldn't bear to wear them any more than 15 minutes consecutively. Even came to find out that I got a size too BIG. The left shoe somehow wasn't completely symmetrical to the right. My left heal was loose enough that it would slide around my Achilles while my right was pretty snug. My last problem would be that the company itself (wild sherpa) doesn't cover the return shipping cost putting me almost 10 dollars in the hole just for trying them.",Complete and utter disappointment,2.0,B0002XLELE

"The curse of the short person legs strikes again.  I had read other reviews about it fitting too loosely, so I had hoped these could zip over my calves, but like most boots these did not.  I'm by no means fat (115lbs, 5', xtra small sized clothing and size 0-4 jeans) - it just seems that most manufacturers scale down leg size in proportion with foot size, which is not cool when you actually use your legs to walk/run/bike and build a normal amount of muscle.  The top part was fine over my thighs, and the shoe part was surprisingly comfortable (only tested standing since I obviously couldn't walk about with the top parts flapping about).","The shoe part itself is comfortable, but it doesn't fit over my calf",3.0,B0002Z1LHO

"I've looked far and wide for this particular sandal, searching locally but the price was always more than I wanted to pay. I couldn't believe my luck to find them on Amazon.com at such a great savings. Now, to the sandal!! Columbia's Surf Tide Sandal is probably the most comfortable sandal you could buy, at least it has been for me. It is well constructed and is so comfortable. It's great for wet or dry sports. Very good traction, and I really appreciate the the non- slip inner sole and outer sole. It's the only sandal I wear for outdoor activies. Also, I like the velcro straps that allow me to adjust the width as well as the tightness of the sandal. If you love the outdoors, camping, water sports, etc. This is the sandal for you!!! And the price is definitely a plus!",GREAT SANDALS-GREAT PRICE,5.0,B0006OC6OS

"I bought these for personal use at home after not having danced in quite some time and wanting an inexpensive pair in which to practise. They fit perfectly. My normal shoe was a bloch sonata in size 5D but, this is a wonderful equivalent shoe. My street shoe size is 7.5M so the 2 1/2 difference was spot on for me. The toe is tapered yet still wide enough to accommodate a silicone support. I'll be sticking with Capezio for a while! :)",Perfect for reintroduction to Pointe,5.0,B0002RFPJM
"I bought these pointe shoes for my daughter who is studying to become a professional ballerina.  The pointe shoe manager at her ballet school fit her in these because of the shape of her feet - and especially her short toes.  While she has small, boxy feet, these shoes, with their shorter vamp, make them look long and elegant.  The shoes are well made and last as long as any other pointe shoe on the market.",The perfect pointe shoe,5.0,B0002RFPJM
