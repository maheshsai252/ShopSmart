","This Timex Watch (but not any battery, crystal, band, or strap) is warranted to the owner for a period of ONE YEAR from the date of purchase against defects in manufacture by Timex Corporation. Timex will not repair defects relating to servicing not performed by Timex Corporation. This limited warranty applies to US Customers.
The Timex T78061 Youth digital watch is reliable, durable, and readable in the dark, thanks to the integrated Indiglo night-light, but it's also flat-out fun to wear. It features an easily readable digital display with large, recognizable icons for the chrono, alarm, and timer functions, and a comfortable elastic fabric strap (for better dirt and stain resistance) with a rocket ship against a black base. This watch also offers water resistance to 30 meters (99 feet), 12/24-hour time, durable translucent blue resin case, large function buttons, and Timex's unique Kids Loss Protection Plan. It's recommended for children ages 6 and older.
The Indiglo night-light uniformly lights the surface of the watch dial using patented blue electroluminescent lighting technology. It uses less battery power than most other watch illumination systems, enabling your watch battery to last longer. The Night Mode feature allows you to illuminate the Indiglo night-light for 3 seconds with any button press, regardless of the mode or function.
Timex understands that kids often lose things, even their most prized possessions, which is why this watch is covered by the Timex Kids Loss Protection Plan. If the watch is lost, Timex will replace it with the same style (or similar if your style is not available) at the price of $10 for up to one year from the original date of purchase, with no questions asked. Details are included in the printed instructions that come with the watch.

Harry Potter Kids' Chasing the Snitch Edition Collectible Watch,"Quality Japanese-Quartz movement
Stainless-steel-case-back case; Blue dial
Water-resistant to 99 feet (30 M)
","A perfect gift for fans of the Harry Potter book and movies series, this clever watch portrays the young wizard himself, in mid-flight on his broomstick, as he chases down the elusive golden snitch. The snitch itself, a prized catch in the wizarding game of Quidditch, is barely visible on the watch dial--that is, until you press the button at the top right. This action causes the snitch to light up in blue and makes it appear to flutter across the dial. The round dial has silvertone hands, including a second hand, but no numbers or indexes to take away from the cool dial image. Instead, the silvertone bezel features small raised dots that serve as hour markers. The dial is housed in a round case that measures about 1 1/2 inches in diameter and features a hypoallergenic stainless steel back. This watch presents on a black genuine leather strap with a smooth tan manmade backing and fastens with a buckle closure. It features Japan quartz movement and is water resistant to 30 meters.
This watch comes packaged in a cool-looking tin embellished with Harry Potter images. Harry himself graces the lid, striking a dramatic pose with his wand. Along the sides are pictures of Hogwarts Castle and of Harry's trusty messenger owl, Hedwig. In a clever design feature, the bottom of the tin is equipped with two coin slots, so that once kids have removed the watch, they can flip the tin over and re-use it as a piggy bank.

With the launch of its first watch in November 1974, Casio entered the wristwatch market at a time when the watch industry had just discovered digital technology. As a company with cutting-edge electronic technology developed for pocket calculators, Casio entered this field confident that it could develop timepieces that would lead the market.
Today, Casio is focusing its efforts on solar-powered radio-controlled watches: the built-in solar battery eliminates the nuisance of replacing batteries, atomic timekeeping means the users never have to reset the time. Recently, Casio launched a series of Bluetooth watches that sync to the users cell phone to automatically update the time. Casio is always moving time forward.

With the launch of its first watch in November 1974, Casio entered the wristwatch market at a time when the watch industry had just discovered digital technology. As a company with cutting-edge electronic technology developed for pocket calculators, Casio entered this field confident that it could develop timepieces that would lead the market.
Today, Casio is focusing its efforts on solar-powered radio-controlled watches: the built-in solar battery eliminates the nuisance of replacing batteries, atomic timekeeping means the users never have to reset the time. Recently, Casio launched a series of Bluetooth watches that sync to the users cell phone to automatically update the time. Casio is always moving time forward.

About Nike Nike watches are built to endure extreme outdoor conditions without missing a beat and they adhere to the company's founding mission statement: to bring inspiration and innovation to every athlete in the world. And as Nike co-founder Bill Bowerman would add--if you have a body, you're an athlete. Ever since the fateful day in 1971 when University of Oregon track coach Bowerman poured rubber into his wife's waffle iron, technological innovation has been the spark that lights Nike's fire. The Waffle outsole transformed the running world and soon after Nike Air evolved Nike's revolutionary impact on sports. Beyond shoes--from watches and eyewear to carry gear and even socks--Nike is committed to giving athletes of every make, model and body style, who compete and recreate in ways never before imagined, the very best performance product. Here are just a few important dates in Nike's journey:  American record-holder Steve Prefontaine becomes the first major track athlete to wear Nike brand shoes in 1973. At the 1976 Olympic Trials, Nike shoes are seen in abundance for the first time--worn by young, rising stars in both middle- and long-distance events. The first athlete to win an Olympic medal wearing Nike shoes is British runner, Steve Ovett in the 1980 Moscow Games The Just Do It advertising campaign began in 1988, and is now ensconced in the Americana exhibit at the Smithsonian National Museum.

Casio
With the launch of its first watch in November 1974, Casio entered the wristwatch market at a time when the watch industry had just discovered digital technology. As a company with cutting-edge electronic technology developed for pocket calculators, Casio entered this field confident that it could develop timepieces that would lead the market.
Today, Casio is focusing its efforts on solar-powered radio-controlled watches: the built-in solar battery eliminates the nuisance of replacing batteries, atomic timekeeping means the users never have to reset the time. Recently, Casio launched a series of Bluetooth watches that sync to the users cell phone to automatically update the time. Casio is always moving time forward.

Timex Group B.V. is one of the best-known American watch companies. Timex's U.S. headquarters are located in Middlebury Connecticut and it has substantial operations in China, the Philippines and India and full scale sales companies in Canada, the UK, France and Mexico.
The company began in 1854 as Waterbury Clock in Connecticut's Naugatuck Valley, known during the nineteenth century as the ""Switzerland of America."" Sister company Waterbury Watch manufactured the first inexpensive mechanical pocket watch in 1880. During World War I, Waterbury began making wristwatches, which had only just become popular, and in 1933 it made history by creating the first Mickey Mouse clock under license from Walt Disney, with Mickey's hands pointing the time.
During World War II, Waterbury renamed itself U.S. Time Company. In 1950 the company introduced a wristwatch called the Timex. Over the next three decades, Timex was sold through a series of advertisements which emphasized its durability by putting the watch through ""torture tests,"" such as falling over the Grand Coulee Dam or being strapped to the propeller of an outboard motor, with the slogan ""It takes a licking and keeps on ticking."" With the help of former Olympic broadcaster, spokesman John Cameron Swayze, sales took off. The company later became Timex Corporation, then Timex Group and, to date, has sold over one billion watches.
The company has remained very competitive and the Timex brand continues its dominance through present day. Its primary market remains the United States and Canada, although the Timex brand is sold worldwide due to its ability to capitalize on its strong brand image and reputation for quality.
One of the most successful and important features available on many Timex watches is the Indiglo backlight system. Indiglo is a brand name of Indiglo Corporation, solely owned by Timex for licensing purposes. Timex electroluminescent lamps, branded Indiglo, were introduced in 1992 in the Ironman watch line. They were an immediate success. The Indiglo lamp uniformly lights the surface of the Timexs watch dials in a manner that makes the dial read very easily in many different light settings. In some newer watches the Indiglo backlight only lights up the numbers, rather than the entire LCD display, which is achieved by means of a specialized film that inverts the LCD transmissivity.
Today, Timex Group products are manufactured in the Far East and in Switzerland often based on technology that continues to be developed in the United States and in Germany. With a large and varied line of watches, Timex has the style for everyone. From the locker room to the board room, there is a great Timex style time-piece for you.

","Casio
With the launch of its first watch in November 1974, Casio entered the wristwatch market at a time when the watch industry had just discovered digital technology. As a company with cutting-edge electronic technology developed for pocket calculators, Casio entered this field confident that it could develop timepieces that would lead the market.
Today, Casio is focusing its efforts on solar-powered radio-controlled watches: the built-in solar battery eliminates the nuisance of replacing batteries, atomic timekeeping means the users never have to reset the time. Recently, Casio launched a series of Bluetooth watches that sync to the users cell phone to automatically update the time. Casio is always moving time forward.

","For over 80 years the adidas Group has been part of the world of sports on every level, delivering state-of-the-art sports footwear, apparel and accessories--including casual and sport watches. The idea was as simple as it was brilliant. Adi Dasslers aim was to provide every athlete with the best possible equipment. It all began in 1920, when Adi Dassler made his first shoes using the few materials available after the First World War. In 1948 he introduced Adidas as the company name, a combination of his own first and last name, and the company's big breakthrough came when Germany won the Soccer World Cup in 1954. In the legendary Final against Hungary, the German team wore boots with screw-in studs made by Adidas.
Today, Adidas makes a variety of watch styles--from basic timepieces for sporty casual wear to analog and digital chronographs that help you reach your training goals with a variety of innovative features. For instance, the Shadow Race Mode on select Adidas digital running watches enables you to race against your best running times. With retro, fashion and performance watches, Adidas watches are all youll need to keep track of your performance and time tracking needs.

","This Timex watch with a fun, whimsical design is perfect children just learning to tell time.

Timex Group B.V. is one of the best-known American watch companies. Timex's U.S. headquarters are located in Middlebury Connecticut and it has substantial operations in China, the Philippines and India and full scale sales companies in Canada, the UK, France and Mexico.
The company began in 1854 as Waterbury Clock in Connecticut's Naugatuck Valley, known during the nineteenth century as the ""Switzerland of America."" Sister company Waterbury Watch manufactured the first inexpensive mechanical pocket watch in 1880. During World War I, Waterbury began making wristwatches, which had only just become popular, and in 1933 it made history by creating the first Mickey Mouse clock under license from Walt Disney, with Mickey's hands pointing the time.
During World War II, Waterbury renamed itself U.S. Time Company. In 1950 the company introduced a wristwatch called the Timex. Over the next three decades, Timex was sold through a series of advertisements which emphasized its durability by putting the watch through ""torture tests,"" such as falling over the Grand Coulee Dam or being strapped to the propeller of an outboard motor, with the slogan ""It takes a licking and keeps on ticking."" With the help of former Olympic broadcaster, spokesman John Cameron Swayze, sales took off. The company later became Timex Corporation, then Timex Group and, to date, has sold over one billion watches.
The company has remained very competitive and the Timex brand continues its dominance through present day. Its primary market remains the United States and Canada, although the Timex brand is sold worldwide due to its ability to capitalize on its strong brand image and reputation for quality.
One of the most successful and important features available on many Timex watches is the Indiglo backlight system. Indiglo is a brand name of Indiglo Corporation, solely owned by Timex for licensing purposes. Timex electroluminescent lamps, branded Indiglo, were introduced in 1992 in the Ironman watch line. They were an immediate success. The Indiglo lamp uniformly lights the surface of the Timex’s watch dials in a manner that makes the dial read very easily in many different light settings. In some newer watches the Indiglo backlight only lights up the numbers, rather than the entire LCD display, which is achieved by means of a specialized film that inverts the LCD transmissivity.

","This Timex watch with a fun, whimsical design is perfect children just learning to tell time.

Timex Group B.V. is one of the best-known American watch companies. Timex's U.S. headquarters are located in Middlebury Connecticut and it has substantial operations in China, the Philippines and India and full scale sales companies in Canada, the UK, France and Mexico.
The company began in 1854 as Waterbury Clock in Connecticut's Naugatuck Valley, known during the nineteenth century as the ""Switzerland of America."" Sister company Waterbury Watch manufactured the first inexpensive mechanical pocket watch in 1880. During World War I, Waterbury began making wristwatches, which had only just become popular, and in 1933 it made history by creating the first Mickey Mouse clock under license from Walt Disney, with Mickey's hands pointing the time.
During World War II, Waterbury renamed itself U.S. Time Company. In 1950 the company introduced a wristwatch called the Timex. Over the next three decades, Timex was sold through a series of advertisements which emphasized its durability by putting the watch through ""torture tests,"" such as falling over the Grand Coulee Dam or being strapped to the propeller of an outboard motor, with the slogan ""It takes a licking and keeps on ticking."" With the help of former Olympic broadcaster, spokesman John Cameron Swayze, sales took off. The company later became Timex Corporation, then Timex Group and, to date, has sold over one billion watches.
The company has remained very competitive and the Timex brand continues its dominance through present day. Its primary market remains the United States and Canada, although the Timex brand is sold worldwide due to its ability to capitalize on its strong brand image and reputation for quality.
One of the most successful and important features available on many Timex watches is the Indiglo backlight system. Indiglo is a brand name of Indiglo Corporation, solely owned by Timex for licensing purposes. Timex electroluminescent lamps, branded Indiglo, were introduced in 1992 in the Ironman watch line. They were an immediate success. The Indiglo lamp uniformly lights the surface of the Timex’s watch dials in a manner that makes the dial read very easily in many different light settings. In some newer watches the Indiglo backlight only lights up the numbers, rather than the entire LCD display, which is achieved by means of a specialized film that inverts the LCD transmissivity.

Now we can be adults and have our slap, too, by wearing these slap bracelet watches. The cool rubber is super durable and the watch face can be popped out and put into another color band, which makes one perfect no matter what youre wearing.

","In 1995 a small Huntington Beach garage was buzzing with activity. Friends were busy hand sewing wallets and handbags with scraps of Naugahyde. Characters with whimsical names like Julius and Skurvy were created to decorate these accessories, originally made as gifts. Little did this small collective know, the unprecedented excitement and interest in these adorable characters would soon thrust their little company to overnight success. Born out of the need for a fun outlet celebrating creativity and individuality in Southern California, Paul Frank Industries (PFI) was formally incorporated in December of 1997. With its bright color palette and unique sensibilities, the company has attracted an almost cult-like following of all ages that love PFI’s witty take on everyday objects. Take, for example, their use of Naugahyde. A vinyl that is more commonly associated with mid-century automobile seats, was hard to come by and completely unique to fashion accessories in 1995. Years later, Paul Frank still incorporates it into key pieces each season. Just like their offbeat and unique product line, PFI achieved success with an unusual, almost anti-marketing approach to business. They were making their mark and Brandweek Magazine recognized the company in 2001 as ""Marketers of the Next Generation"", a remarkable feat for a small start-up with a handful of employees. As the company evolved, their plans to create fun products they wanted for themselves became a marketing plan in itself. PFI employees (young as well as young at heart – their average is 27) have always been inspired by art, music, architecture and entertainment. They stretched the boundaries of their Southern California suburbs designing guitar straps for The White Stripes, Foo Fighters and Weezer (just to mention a few!), to special edition t-shirts for Coachella. Artistic inspirations range from classic contemporary furniture designers like Eames and Saarinen to abstract sculptor and inventor of the mobile Alexander Calder, to the infamous pop artist Andy Warhol. The Elvis Presley Foundation and LEGO; as well as legendary American businesses John Deere, Mattel, Dr. Scholl's and Oscar Mayer have all worked with Paul Frank Industries in collaboration programs producing highly collectable items pre-sold before they hit stores and never reproduced. Paul Frank Industries clothing, t-shirts and other products achieved excellent visibility. The brand appeared in numerous blockbuster films like Superbad, Knocked Up, Austin Powers, American Pie and Charlie's Angels. From fashion and business, music and lifestyle, the media love to know what is happening at Paul Frank. Pop Stars (Hilary Duff, Avril Lavigne), punk bands (Bad Religion, The Donnas, Alkaline Trio), and indie rocks finest (The White Stripes, The Shins, Interpol, Pretty Girls Make Graves, Hot Hot Heat) all make stops at Paul Frank before heading out on tour. Actors like Jason Schwarzman, Elijah Wood, Zooey Deschanel and Michael Rapaport have been known to stop in and say hello. The company launched its own retail division, The Paul Frank Store. Currently there are eighteen stores worldwide: Southern California, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Dallas, Chicago and New York City, as well as international locations in London, Amsterdam, Berlin, Dubai, Qatar, Bangkok, Athens, and Taipei. New stores in 2007 will open in Japan and Malaysia. Think all that success has changed the bright, young minds at Paul Frank Industries? Hardly. For one, they've remembered their friends who helped them start it all. The company still makes gifts for their friends and gives back to the community. They are involved with various philanthropic endeavors that directly benefit children, the arts and the environment. They have partnered with Festival of Children, Boarding for Breast Cancer, The Elton John AIDS Foundation, First Book and The Children's Hospital of Los Angeles. Their retail division has key events throughout the year that educate and promote special causes: The Winter Coat Drive, The Annual Book Drive, Earth Day and College Nite.

A lot of watches claim to be time teachers, but this one truly is!
Power Rangers Super Samurai is the all-new, half-hour series that features a new cast of Rangers and never-before-seen villains, as well as high-octane action, martial arts and advanced special effects. New episodes premiere Saturdays at noon (ET/PT) on Nickelodeon. Currently in its 19th season, Power Rangers Super Samurai is helmed by Haim Saban, who created and produced the original Mighty Morphin Power Rangers series in 1993. Following its introduction, Power Rangers quickly became the most-watched children’s television program in the United States. Emphasizing the importance of teamwork, responsibility and helping others by following the adventures of a group of ordinary young people who “morphed” into superheroes, the series was seen in more than 60 countries, translated into numerous languages, and was a mainstay in the most prominent international children’s programming blocks. Power Rangers LLC, which licenses and merchandises the Power Rangers brand, is an affiliate of Saban Brands.
