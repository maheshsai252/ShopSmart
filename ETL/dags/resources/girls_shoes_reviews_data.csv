"just love these boots. needed a plain black pair.. didn't want a heavy boot or a ridiculous price. so of course i went to Amazon and looked for timberland boots. my favorite place to shop and my favorite boot manufacturer. got a great price- fast delivery and a pair of boots in perfect condition. very happy with this purchase. i am a womens size 7= a 5.5 big kid in almost all timberlands. this is the only place that gives me the 3 things i need when buying tims, size,variety of design and prices i love! best part is i can shop in my pajamas :)",great light-weight boot,5.0,B000073R5V

"Recently bought these for my 8 yr old who plays football at recess everyday - last school year we went through about 5-6 pair of tennis shoes; I needed sturdy, but stylish, affordable but not cheap...and they had to be all white for his uniform.

"Thank you K-Swiss for making this shoe for decades.  I remember wanting a pair in the 1970's and now my kids are wearing them.  My children's school has a dress code with all white tennis shoes, which are hard to find.  In addition, I have tried to buy cheaper shoes and have ended up replacing them every 1-2 weeks - I'm not sure how my kids destroy them but it's downright frightening to my wallet.  So I invested in the K-Swiss and have not been sorry.  I literally bought 7 pairs of other shoes between September and December, then bought the K-Swiss and they lasted for over a year until my daughter grew out of them.  I do recommend printing out the size chart and making sure you get the right size.",Solid and Kid-Proof,5.0,B0000A50X8

"I bought these from the store Whats Hot and they were shipping by amazon. They are absolutely not authentic. Several flaws in the boots. Biggest being the inside. Tags inside aren't stitched as it should be. Shoe tag is so thin is practically see through and its on a flimsy plastic chain. And No Timberlands are made in Vietnam. Anyone who has owned a pair can tell the difference immediately. I will go down to the store and spend the extra $10 to get an authentic pair. The pictures of the black boot are the same size and style from a authorized Timberland dealer. While they are decent looking fakes, there are several flaws in the way they were made. Not nearly as quality as a real pair of timberlands feel. Whatever material this is made with wouldnt last a day. And my timbs last me years.

I do not believe what i received were even real timberland boots. They were supposed to be waterproof and they got wet immediately when i wore them in the snow.

"This review is for adults buying the big kid shoe

I am an 8-8 1/2, and I ordered the 6. WAY too big, I felt like my feet were floating around in them. I am sad to say goodbye, so I ordered two more sizes smaller to see what works. Also note that these might feel/look a little bigger than an adult timberland because kids shoes provide MORE room at the TOE. I am hoping that with the proper size, this won't matter so much. Will update review based on that!

Note: my true foot size is probably in between an 8 and 8 1/2, if that helps at all. I normally just have to go with a different size depending on the brand of shoe.","Adult size 8-8.5, ordered 6, too big",4.0,B0000AFSX4

"My 9 y.o. wore a pair of red ones similar to these out completely because she wore them everywhere, and was heartbroken when we couldn't find another pair like them at the store we had gotten them at originally. I found these and we gave them to her for her birthday. She LOVES them and wears them constantly. We ordered a 13 1/2 because she is just about out of a size 12 and we wanted her to be able to wear these for a while. They fit a little big but its not enough to bother her and she does not trip over the toes. Will no doubt be ordering again when she wears this pair out too. 

*Update* January 2018: My daughter got these boots at the end of June 2017. They fell apart by October 2017. Her last pair of boots (the red ones i mentioned) were a similar style and price range but were purchased at a farm implement store and she wore them for 2 years, almost every single day and they lasted. These are cheaply made and sadly, if you want a quality pair for your child, these are not it.",If you want boots to last...order something else,2.0,B0001YJ0YC

Dollar for dollar you can do much better with a less expensive boot like an EMU or BEAR which I have also purchased. The name is what your paying for, this is not a top end elegant product,it is of NEW YORK street corner knock off quality. This is unfortunate because at one time, years ago this was an excellent boot that was well constructed it had a hand made attention to detail quality to it, now it's just a high priced boot thats selling on past popularity. Thats my opinion and I'm stuck with it.",Made in China,2.0,B0002ZCBKA
"OMG these are the best boots i have ever bought!! they are so warm and comfortable .. i cant explain in words how fantastic they are!! I only wish that i jumped on the ""ugg""ly boot bandwagon last year!! I got the Chocolate, mainly because i know that the sand can stain easier and i personally prefer darker shoes. I am so happy with my purchase i think i might be getting some family members a pair for the holiday! i do agree to order one size smaller, i was hesitant, because i have large feet (10) but the 9 fits like a glove.

also, if your feet are ladies size 8 or smaller, it is cheaper to buy the children's uggs! (only thought of this after i bought mine.)

"I have a medium width foot, I  bought a size 4.5  Big kids medium, these shoes run wide, they slip in the heel but aren't too big in length.  I  normally wear a Big Kids ASICS  in 4.5 M. The traction on the soul is excellent, but there's absolutely no padding inside the shoes, so if you're a walker, I  suggest buying some SPENCO  Polysorb inner soles because these shoes give you absolutely no cushioning.  For the price it was an excellent buy. Merrells are very well made shoes, I think these will last a long time. I was forced to buy the purple, which looks like burgundy on the website, but it's actually a deep purple or plum; nicer in person then the color on the website. I wish they had had them in black or charcoal, a more neutral color. I'm an adult female and I normally wear a women's size 5.5 to 6 but with all the shoes being made in China I find that I wear a different size sometimes even within the same brand. I have a pair of MERRELL UGGs  and those are womens size 5.5 so buy a half size larger and if you have a medium with foot wear thick socks.

And I didn't care about the color, I would have taken pretty much any color, but coincidentally they are the same color as the ones I lost!

I am an adult lucky enough to be able to wear children's shoes, which cost much less. I wear a 7 or 7.5 in women's shoes, and often a 5 in kid's. But I'd read the reviews of these so I got the 5.5 and they are beyond perfect.

"My son loves his bowling shoes. They fit perfectly. This is out second pair. I got these a size bigger so he can use them for 2 years. They are super comfortable, nice looking and he is getting them used to its full in his weekly bowling league. I thought they might be for girls but look like they might be for both boys and girls. Very happy with my purchase.",wonderful fit,5.0,B000B1LAXY
"The shoes came as described.  As others have stated, the shoes run small.  Since these are kid's shoes, I didn't want to get something that I would have to replace after 6 months when my kid's feet grew a bit more.  I decided to order 2 sizes larger than my daughter's shoe size.  I even measured her feet and lined it up with the shoe chart.  The shoes were slightly larger than my daughter's current shoe size and did not even come close to being 2 sizes larger.  I knew it ran small, but that was a little extreme.","works fine, runs small",3.0,B000B1LAXY

"I would definitely recommend these shoes.  They do run a bit on the small side, but after reading others reviews, I had planned for that.  My 6-year old typically wears a size 1, so I purchased the size 3 in hopes of getting more wear for our buck out of them.  They are a bit big, but that's OK - not too big to hinder her wearing them.  Will definitely purchase more when these do not fit any longer.",Awesome!!,5.0,B000B1LAXY
"These are really good shoes for a beginning bowler. They fit well, have a ""universal"" design so you don't have to worry about getting ""right handed or left handed approach"" shoes. Sliding foot breaks in quickly and the non sliding foot stays unchanged so you don't slip while approaching. Great price point for a basic shoe that will last as long as your kid's feet still fit in them!(and  then get handed down the line!) WAY better deal than renting shoes at $5/time if your kids like to go bowling more than a few times each year.
  Truth be told, I have the adult version of these shoes for myself and I bowl in leagues. They're 4 years old and still look and fit as well as the day I bought them. It was my experience with them that made me choose them for my girl when she got into bowling too.",Great basic bowling shoes,5.0,B000B1LAXY

"Excited for my daughter to wear aesthetically pleasing and functionally well thought out pair of rain boots this Spring. The ease of keeping her sneaker's on, clean, and dry going to school appealed to me. I got a size bigger to compensate for the ""putting on and taking off"" with her shoes on. The velcro fastener is easy to use and secure. BUT! Manufacturing quality is very effed up. Worst, is that it's made here in our very own United States of America. These boots are why companies are going overseas. Overpaid, entitled American workers throw products to consumers without the care and pride that our parents generation of factory workers had. Maybe I just got that mistake pair that was bypassed by the factory workers and quality control. Maybe my pair happens to be dumpster rejects bought by a shady retail company looking only to throw cash in their pockets without the morals of a real business. Maybe I'm overreacting to rubber rain boots that will only fit my daughter for only one of many spring seasons of her life. Maybe if grandma had balls, she'd be grandpa.

All in all, the owners, inventors and designers of these boots had the right idea and track, the people making them... Screwed it up. Flashing everywhere and a short shot on the bottom front of the sole. Really came down to the manufacturing. This boot deserves to be made with 100% real American pride and quality. Be aware future buyer. Don't perpetuate poor quality American products just because they're made in the USA. Buy them if they're great American products.",Made in USA... poorly.,2.0,B000BH0372

So now that she's outgrown them and her rapidly growing little toes are smashing against the front, I went ahead and bought the next size up (7). As soon as I got them out of the package I thought they looked like the exact same size as the 6s. When I held the soles perfectly together they WERE the same size; exactly the same size even though the stamped size number on the boot is 7! So I returned them and ordered 8s. I hope the 8s aren't way too big. We'll see.

"As I opened the package these boots arrived in I was plesantly greeted with the cutest shoebox i've ever seen.  The box has made a wonderful toy for my two year old! The bad news is that when I opened the shoe box I was assailed with a strong chemical odor.  I don't like the idea of my child being exposed to whatever this chemical is however since I purchased these boots just for puddles on rainy days and not for everyday use, I decided to keep them.  I also have left them outside on the porch for the last month to see if the smell would dissapate and while it has a little they still have a strong chemical odor.

The boots are very cute, sturdy and look exactly as the picture shows.  They are shiny and look amazing.

I love them. My kid loves them. He would wear his boots for any occasion... if I let him.

We've always bought the correct size for him. The only time the sizing seemed off was with a pair of Lady Bug boots - too small. So, I just wrapped them up and gave them to a friend's daughter for her birthday. They are just that classy - kids love them. My son has had two pairs of the frog boots, two pairs of the bumble bee boots (I have a pair of these as well and they've held up well to my  heavy duty gardening antics), and one pair of dinosaur boots.

I'm so surprised that others have had a bad experience with these boots. I've found the Western Chief boots to be the cadillacs of rubber boots.

What a hassle to return them and find the Kidorable boots which are just as cute, but don't have the pull-on handles, and also do not leak.",Leaky! Smelly!,1.0,B000E4AFUW

"I ordered a size down for both my kids bc I read previous reviews warning that they run large. The size 5 matches my son's size 5 Robeez, which he is growing out of.  The size 5 rainboots are definitely smaller than his size 6 See Kai Runs. The size 9 rainboots are the same length as my older son's size 9 Vans. It seems to me that the sizing is pretty standard. I now need to return these and order a size 6 and 10. BTW, the size 9 Western Chief rainboots are equal in length to BOTH size 8 Old Navy rainboots AND size 6-7 Melissa and Doug rainboots.",standard sizing,4.0,B000E4AFUW
"Just a little over a month since my son started wearing these adorable boots, they have fallen to pieces.

He has had 3 pair of this type of boot and EVERY pair has split at the sole and upper juncture.  They have also split near the frog's eyes.  While we love the boot's look...it is not economical to buy a boot that lasts, at the most, only 6 weeks.",not so sturdy,1.0,B000E4AFUW
I bought this for my 4 yr old daughter for use around the yard when it's wet and soggy. She loves it! The hooks on the side lets here be able to pull them on. Word of advice - she needs to wear socks to prevent her ankles getting bruised while rubbing on the inside.,Great value!!,5.0,B000E4AFUW
"We received our original pair of Western Chief Frog Boots as a gift. My oldest son adored them. They did scuff up a bit, but he continued to wear them and love them. Our Second son used them for quite a while. We then purchased a second pair for the oldest since he outgrew the first pair. Then a third pair for the second son, who then passed the second pair to the third son. Whose boots were recently chewed up by the dog! So - the forth pair will be soon to come...

They are kids boots and you should not expect them to stay perfect, though the wear did not seem excessive to me. You can find ""similar"" boots at Target for about $10 less, but they are not as cute, have less detail and don't hold up as well, in my experience.",Very good product and cute too!,4.0,B000E4AFUW

They are very cute, but after just one weekend of kicking around on a beach, they are completely scuffed up and look like they are a year old.  My son doesn't care, but it looks to me like they won't last very long before they develop leaks at this rate.  We have had Xtratufs for kids before, and they are by far the most durable rainboot I know of (my second son is using hand-me-down Xtratufs that are still in great shape), but they are a dull olive color and, as far as my 4YO is concerned, they can't compete with more colorful versions.",Cute but not durable,2.0,B000E4AFUW
"We've been buying Western Chief rain boots for my son since he was 20 months old. We are on our 5th pair and I'm placing an order for our 6th and 7th pairs (as I have to pay duty). Oh, and a second pair for me! Red.

I love them. My kid loves them. He would wear his boots for any occasion... if I let him.

We've always bought the correct size for him. The only time the sizing seemed off was with a pair of Lady Bug boots - too small. So, I just wrapped them up and gave them to a friend's daughter for her birthday. They are just that classy - kids love them. My son has had two pairs of the frog boots, two pairs of the bumble bee boots (I have a pair of these as well and they've held up well to my  heavy duty gardening antics), and one pair of dinosaur boots.

I'm so surprised that others have had a bad experience with these boots. I've found the Western Chief boots to be the cadillacs of rubber boots. I pass them down to my nieces and nephews and they are still all going strong. Well-loved. Well-used. Well-worn.",No more struggles over Boots!,5.0,B000E4AFUW
"I bought these boots for my twenty-month-old.  They cracked and began disintigrating in one week of moderate use in Springtime temperatures, mud, and puddles.  They do not come in widths, because, as we parents know, all children are the same size.  Hence, they fit REALLY well (note the sarcasm here).

"Last fall I bought a pair of these (size 6) for my granddaughter and they've been perfect in every way. Very sturdy, nice fit. So now that she's outgrown them and her rapidly growing little toes are smashing against the front, I went ahead and bought the next size up (7). As soon as I got them out of the package I thought they looked like the exact same size as the 6s. When I held the soles perfectly together they WERE the same size; exactly the same size even though the stamped size number on the boot is 7! So I returned them and ordered 8s. I hope the 8s aren't way too big. We'll see.

"Raising a family in Idaho, where there might be snow on the ground 6 months of the year and sometimes it snows daily for weeks, Sorels were perfect. They are very warm; feet don't get cold even after hours in the snow. Perfect for hiking, apres ski, winter camping. The footing is sure even on icy or melting surfaces. The liners can be removed to air-dry, which is important because they do get wet from body moisture, and snow eventually cakes on the exposed lining. The whole family wore Sorels all winter long. They last forever; I have never had a pair wear out before the child outgrew them, and they were always fit to be passed down to another child.",I think these would work on Everest,5.0,B000JCSN30

"I had a wonderful pair of Sorels for about 10 years until they finally gave out. When I went to buy new ones, there were very few styles available in my size (I'm an adult with small feet, so wear kids sizes). I ordered these because they were closest to my old ones but had to return them because the upper is too narrow. They have the new ""bungie"" style strings instead of regular shoe strings you tie so there is not enough expansion room to open them up. Even if I had removed their string and put in regular shoe strings, the upper does not have enough room to open up and allow more than a skinny chicken leg in it. If you or your child have normal sized legs, you may have an issue putting these on.

Sorels in general are the warmest boots around and my old pair lasted a really long time with frequent wear, so I'm really disappointed that I have not been able to find a good replacement pair for the ones I wore out.

"I wear a size 7.5 in Women's shoes, so the size 7 boot is a little too big for me.  I make up for this by wearing many pairs of socks.  The boots are very heavy to walk in, but I'm not sure if it's because the size is too big or if it is the normal fit for the shoe.  My feet definitely stay warm, but after walking in the boots for up to 10 minutes, I feel like I've exercised because the boots are sooo heavy.  Other than this, the boots are good.  I live in Boston and with the weather we have right now, I can't afford to return them and wait for new ones to come...which is why I'm keeping them.

"First of all, these shoes are gorgeous. The perfect dressy Mary Jane. Almost. However, they are dress shoes and like all beautiful girls' or ladies' shoes, they are meant to be admired and not worn when a lot of walking is required. I normally would not pay so much for a child's dress shoe or buy shoes online without trying them on but I was desperate. We needed them to wear with a costume my daughter was wearing and we couldn't find any Mary Janes in our town that fit her. After a day of being on her feet she couldn't wait to take them off. They didn't pinch, but they have hard soles and zero cushion. Her feet were tired. Because I bought them sight unseen they ended up being a little big and slipped up and down on her heel so I fixed with little gel inserts from the drug store. Worked great with knee socks. The width was perfect and they did look adorable. If comfort is more important to you than style, get Stride Rites. These shoes are best worn in doses of a couple hours like for church, parties, or picture day. I'm giving three stars because product is as described and service was fast. I just should have thought harder about how comfortable they would be versus the price knowing my daughter would be wearing them for long periods of time.","Beautiful shoe, but not comfy",3.0,B000JLCN5A

"I have been buying these shoes twice a year (white in spring, black in fall) for my daughter for over 3 years now. It is SO hard to find a good, leather, classic little girl's shoe these days but this one fits the bill perfectly! No glitter, no sequins, no embroidery, just a solid, classic shoe, just like the shoes I wore when I was a little girl. As to the fit, when she was younger, my daughter needed a narrow shoe and this was the only brand I could find readily that was offered in different widths. She is now almost 8 and between a narrow and a medium but she prefers the fit of the medium in this shoe. Some people may feel that they are overpriced but, I disagree. Yes, there are cheaper examples of girls' dress shoes - but I believe you'd be hard-pressed to find a shoe of this quality, in LEATHER, that is offered in different widths for less money. However, you can frequently find excellent deals in certain colors/sizes here on Amazon!

"Bought these for our 4 year old nephew in size 2-3.

If you are new to Rainbow sandals, you should know that if you purchase the size that fits you, the strap will be very tight and uncomfortable. However, if you are able to bear the discomfort for a few days, these sandals will be one of the most comfortable and durable sandals you will wear once broken in. Also, personally, I've owned several pairs of these sandals (in adult sizes) and they last for a couple years AT LEAST with almost daily usage, and the strap has held strong on all of them.

Having said this, we did not want to subject our nephew to this kind of ""break-in discomfort"" especially since he is new to sandals and that his feet are growing quite rapidly, but we wanted to get him his own Rainbows because he wanted to be just like us =). So, the size we got him is a bit bigger than his feet, but he is able to wear them comfortably now and they will break in slowly as his feet get larger.",Awesome sandals!,5.0,B000KJ4F7A

"Bought these for our 4 year old nephew in size 2-3.

If you are new to Rainbow sandals, you should know that if you purchase the size that fits you, the strap will be very tight and uncomfortable. However, if you are able to bear the discomfort for a few days, these sandals will be one of the most comfortable and durable sandals you will wear once broken in. Also, personally, I've owned several pairs of these sandals (in adult sizes) and they last for a couple years AT LEAST with almost daily usage, and the strap has held strong on all of them.

Having said this, we did not want to subject our nephew to this kind of ""break-in discomfort"" especially since he is new to sandals and that his feet are growing quite rapidly, but we wanted to get him his own Rainbows because he wanted to be just like us =). So, the size we got him is a bit bigger than his feet, but he is able to wear them comfortably now and they will break in slowly as his feet get larger.",Awesome sandals!,5.0,B000LVLODU

"I got this for my birthday and a little over a year later it was useless.  The plastic/rubber watch strap just corroded away and broke off.  I went to the Nike Store to get a new strap and they said try a sporting goods store.  Went to a couple and couldn't find any place that sold replacement straps.  I searched the internet high and low and eventually found Parsec Ent.  They sent me a strap for $23.95 (rip off) only to find out that it is impossible to replace the strap.  A good Nike watch going in the trash, bummer.","If you want it for longevity, don't buy it.",1.0,B000E8H0HY
"Previously, I owned an Oregon Scientific heart rate monitor, which worked great for 5 years.  It had basic features which I found useful but needed to replace it because it wasn't as accurate/consistent as it use to be.

I was not sure about buying the Nike Imara Heart Rate Monitor because there weren't any reviews on it.  But I liked the design and color choices and I knew it was designed specifically for women by Nike (a reputable company). Now that I have the product and have used it for 1 week, I feel satisfied with my purchase.  The price was great and I received it quickly from Amazon. The Nike Imara Heart Rate Monitor is pretty, and easy to use.  There are 5 modes: Time, Chronograph, Interval, Data, and Alarm.  It comes with an instruction manual and CD to program the modes.  Both are easy to follow when programming your monitor but the CD adds a nice visual experience for those women that need a demonstration.  The watch band is a nice thick plastic.  It's a little difficult to put on at first but you quickly get use to it.

First and most important, I find that Nike Imara Heart Rate Monitor is accurate when measuring my bpm. I use the chronograph (CHRO) mode which gives your bpm or average bpm and a stop watch.  The rate does not jump around with random, unrealistic heart rate readings.  I chose to wear the chest strap without the elastic strap by placing it inside my sports bra.  I get a nice consistent reading of my heart rate even when I'm jumping around. The out of range alarms are a nice feature that alert you when to work harder or slow down.  You hear a stead single beep when your heart rate is below target and a double beep when it is above target.  I also like the fact that the chest strap transmits my bpm to my exercise machine that has a heart rate monitor on it.

I have not tried the interval training (INTR) mode so I can't comment about it accuracy.  But I'm sure it would be useful for those women that like to exercise at different intensities during their workout and need to know when to change the intensity or be alerted when they are outside of the intensity range.

The DATA mode gives you a summary of your workout accomplishments.  However, you only get this summary if you remember to press the start button during your CHRO or INTR mode.  The summary for your workout includes your total workout time, average bpm, total calorie burned, total time in your target heart rate zone (if you programmed a zone), total time above your target HR zone, and total time below your HR zone.

I think this is a great basic HR monitor.  It's perfect for women in all exercise ranges (weight loss, strength training, etc.) because of the interval training feature.  I also think it's perfect of pregnant women that want to exercise during their pregnancy and keep track of their HR to make sure they are not over exercising.

I may add to or modify this review after using it for a longer period of time.  I hope this was helpful and I hope others write reviews on this HR watch when they purchase it.",Great heart rate monitor,5.0,B000E8H0HY

I don't know what I will do once she grows out of the largest size for this shoe. Hopefully, her foot will thin out by then.  Great shoe though.",I Love this Shoe!,5.0,B000FIJRZG

"My twins wore these shoes for holiday parties.  They fit well with tights.  They have been worn three times so far and have not gotten any scuff marks.

These are great shoes!  My daughter has narrow feet and heels and very tiny ankles.  These are literally one of two styles of shoes that she can wear without any discomfort or rubbing.  Most other shoes give her blisters and raw spots.  The medium width is great for kids with skinny feet and heels.  They are very well made shoes that are very soft and flexible and she is hard on them but they polish up very well.  They are adorable with jeans or skirts and dresses.  A must have for a hard to fit foot.  I don't know what we are going to do once she gets past the size 8!,our favorite shoes for a picky little girl!,5.0,B000FIJRZG

"I purchased these in a size 5 for my daughter because a) they were less than some of the other stride rite shoes and b) they were adorable.  Well, these were just unwearable and I even had them fitted and checked in the stride rite store.  The velcro was always coming undone, the shoes always falling off plus they were very stiff so she had difficulty walking in them.  In the end, we always had to take the shoes off for her to run around in until I finally conceded and bought a pair of the $42 katy (I belive) shoes which  are what you would expect from a stride rite shoe.",Not a good buy!,1.0,B000FIJW7O

"I just received these for my granddaughter.  They are ADORABLE and appear to be well-made, with 'real' leather.  The only reservation I have about them is the buckle.

A few years ago, I was afraid she would grow out of the style (she'd stop liking them). But it just hasn't happened. She still loves them (a tribute to their comfort and enduring style).

When she was younger, the sandals went well with all those girly-dresses. Now, they still go well with her jeans and mini-skirts. (My daughter is VERY style conscious.)

They match everything.

Ladies I wear a size 8 wide.  And I was looking for a hiking sandal for sometime at a reasonable price.  I saw Amazon listed the size as well as the length of the shoe and got out my ruler.  A size five wide shoe was cutting it close I knew that it might not fit but at the Friday Deal price I couldn't resist.  Fast shipping straight to my door.  Out the box and on my feet!  They just barely fit with maybe less than a 1/4inch at the toes. I was concerned I didn't want anything that would cause me to stub my toes on hikes. So I did a stub test and found my foot was still protected.  COOL! This a keeper. The rugged sole will handle any terrain. (I don't know if they're water proof) and the suede like insole is comfortable. The back strap is padded (No blisters!) and the front straps easy to adjust. Cute enought to for walking through the concrete  streets of NYC and rugged enough for Hikes along the Hudson.

However, if you are purchasing these as an athletic shoe to be worn for play and phys. ed, keep in mind that they wear too quickly.  The sole is flexible which is a bonus to allow for a more natural gait, however the rubber is like a pencil eraser and gets rubbed down quickly.  The fabric stretches along the outside and the inside so therefore the support is compromised all around including heel cradle.  A great shoe for casual dress, just not for tough play.

"I have been buying these harley boots for my son since he was 2 years old.  While he may not wear them often (2-3 times a month), he can't live without them! The upper strap on the outside, above the eagle will fall apart with normal wear (1-2 times a week) but the zipper holds up well, along with the soles.  Careful with the toes of the boot, as the top material will easily rip off.  These boots are not for daily play, but he loves them!  The design has not been changed since I began purchasing them four years ago.  Every size fits has fitted my son comfortably and consistently.",Boy's Harley boots,5.0,B000G5VFSK

I don't want my 5 year old son to wear sandals in the summer but I realize that his feet need to breathe during the hot summer days.  These are the perfect compromise.  Closed toe and an open back.  Other than looking very worn, they held up to anything my son did to them.  Wearing them in the ocean, using them as a brake for his bike or scooter...whatever!!

They hold up well, are comfy, and the colors are great.  Easy for the little ones to get on and off make getting in and out a breeze.

"I've always liked the Ugh style boot and have wanted to get a pair like them for my four year old daughter (altough not at the Ugh price). When I purchased these boots they were about $20, which I thought was a very reasonable price.  I also liked the studded bear accent on the boot which is important for my daughter who refuses to where anything unless is is embellished in some way.  Although she has just begun to wear them, she wants to wear them constantly (even in 80 degree whether), but so far so good. Comfort is a major issue for her and at this point she will only wear two pairs of shoes that she has (these being one of the two).

"I made the mistake of not reading the other reviews. Dont do the same. I ordered these shoes for my sons communion. They are used! It is so blatant that they used what appears to be a white marker to cover scuff marks. The coverup is shiny and does not match the rest of the shoe. This is upsetting. How can Amazon attach there name to a product and advertise as new when it is obviously used. Name of the seller is Amazon.com, LLC.
UPDATE 4/30/2014  I have elected to return this used pair of shoes in the hopes of receiving a new pair. I will update the review once the ""new"" pair is received.

UPDATE 5/2/2014 I have received the new pair of shoes. These shoes are in fact new. They are very nice. So maybe it is luck of the draw. Should you decide to order them give yourself enough time to return them should they be used. The thing with these type of products are they are 1 time use.
