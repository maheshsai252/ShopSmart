2.4 ounces","This Timex Watch (but not any battery, crystal, band, or strap) is warranted to the owner for a period of ONE YEAR from the date of purchase against defects in manufacture by Timex Corporation. Timex will not repair defects relating to servicing not performed by Timex Corporation. This limited warranty applies to US Customers.
The Timex T75201 Youth watch is reliable, durable, and readable in the dark, thanks to the integrated Indiglo night-light, but it's also flat-out fun to wear. This quartz analog watch features an easily readable, full Arabic numeral display and smaller 5-minute notations on the outside of the dial. It also has small sports balls that rotate around the dial with the hands, and a comfortable elastic fabric strap (for better dirt and stain resistance) with basketballs, baseballs, and soccer balls against a blue base. This watch also offers water resistance to 30 meters (99 feet), durable black resin case, different colored hour and minute hands, and Timex's unique Kids Loss Protection Plan. It's recommended for children ages 6 and older.
The Indiglo night-light uniformly lights the surface of the watch dial using patented blue electroluminescent lighting technology. It uses less battery power than most other watch illumination systems, enabling your watch battery to last longer.
Timex understands that kids often lose things, even their most prized possessions, which is why this watch is covered by the Timex Kids Loss Protection Plan. If the watch is lost, Timex will replace it with the same style (or similar if your style is not available) at the price of $10 for up to one year from the original date of purchase, with no questions asked.

Ice Petal AmberWatch,"Children's Loud Alert Safety Watch
Protect your child from predators and other threats
Digital watch with full features
Hip, cute style and color
One year warranty","AmberWatch has created a children's digital watch that arms our children against child predators and and other threats. The AmberWatch was designed with a security system that draws attention to children in trouble by using an audio and visual alert system. When a child is in trouble he or she just pushes the two red buttons and the AmberWatch alert is triggered. With sound blaring at 115dB, which can be heard 100+ yards away, and super bright LEDs flashing a visible warning alert, attention is brought to the child in danger helping minimize the risk of abduction or injury. Includes batteries,quickstart guide, and 1 yr warranty card. Please arm your children with the AmberWatch and keep all of our children safe. For every watch sold AmberWatch donates proceeds to the AmberWatch foundation-a nonprofit organization dedicated to the prevention of child abduction and child endangerment.
The most effective means of protecting children from predators is giving them tools to prevent abduction. The AmberWatch was designed to complement safety plans made with parents and to aid in an immediate escape. It is a 115-decibel alarm built into a watch that, when activated, can be heard from 100 yards away. An unmistakable distress signal, it draws attention to dangerous situations and helps children respond strongly when they feel threatened. It can also come into use when a child is lost in a store, park or crowd, when theyre threatened by an animal, if theyre hurt, or if they get lost while participating in activities such as camping, skiing or hiking. The watch has a bulky modern style and super-bright LED lights that can be seen night or day. Digital functions include time, date, alarm, stopwatch, day of the week, low battery and backlight. The alarm is activated by pushing both of the red buttons on either side of the face and deactivated using the same 2 buttons in a coded sequence you set yourself. A special break-away back-up system automatically activates the alarm if the watch is forcibly removed. Amber Watch donates $1 to the AmberWatch Foundation for every watch sold. Water resistant. Adjusts to 6 sizes, approx. 5-3/4L"" to 7-3/4L"". Flower design bezel with an ice pink band.

About Nike At its core, Nike understands the need for play, no matter what your age. And as Nike co-founder Bill Bowerman would say--if you have a body, you're an athlete. Nike's line of youth watches blends the advanced materials and drive for excellence built into the company's adult watches with the same mix of sophistication, guts, and imagination as the kids who wear them. They made to fit kid-sized wrists and sport fun, contemporary designs that will look great in school and out on the playfield.
Beyond shoes--from watches and eyewear to carry gear and even socks--Nike is committed to giving athletes of every make, model and body style, who compete and recreate in ways never before imagined, the very best performance product. Here are just a few important dates in Nike's journey:  American record-holder Steve Prefontaine becomes the first major track athlete to wear Nike brand shoes in 1973. At the 1976 Olympic Trials, Nike shoes are seen in abundance for the first time--worn by young, rising stars in both middle- and long-distance events. The first athlete to win an Olympic medal wearing Nike shoes is British runner, Steve Ovett in the 1980 Moscow Games The Just Do It advertising campaign began in 1988, and is now ensconced in the Americana exhibit at the Smithsonian National Museum.",B000EHIVA0,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31MpUA8mLjL._SR38,50_.jpg']",['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31MpUA8mLjL.jpg'],Boys Watches

Casio
With the launch of its first watch in November 1974, Casio entered the wristwatch market at a time when the watch industry had just discovered digital technology. As a company with cutting-edge electronic technology developed for pocket calculators, Casio entered this field confident that it could develop timepieces that would lead the market.
Today, Casio is focusing its efforts on solar-powered radio-controlled watches: the built-in solar battery eliminates the nuisance of replacing batteries, atomic timekeeping means the users never have to reset the time. Recently, Casio launched a series of Bluetooth watches that sync to the users cell phone to automatically update the time.

Timex Group B.V. is one of the best-known American watch companies. Timex's U.S. headquarters are located in Middlebury Connecticut and it has substantial operations in China, the Philippines and India and full scale sales companies in Canada, the UK, France and Mexico.
The company began in 1854 as Waterbury Clock in Connecticut's Naugatuck Valley, known during the nineteenth century as the ""Switzerland of America."" Sister company Waterbury Watch manufactured the first inexpensive mechanical pocket watch in 1880. During World War I, Waterbury began making wristwatches, which had only just become popular, and in 1933 it made history by creating the first Mickey Mouse clock under license from Walt Disney, with Mickey's hands pointing the time.
During World War II, Waterbury renamed itself U.S. Time Company. In 1950 the company introduced a wristwatch called the Timex. Over the next three decades, Timex was sold through a series of advertisements which emphasized its durability by putting the watch through ""torture tests,"" such as falling over the Grand Coulee Dam or being strapped to the propeller of an outboard motor, with the slogan ""It takes a licking and keeps on ticking."" With the help of former Olympic broadcaster, spokesman John Cameron Swayze, sales took off. The company later became Timex Corporation, then Timex Group and, to date, has sold over one billion watches.
The company has remained very competitive and the Timex brand continues its dominance through present day. Its primary market remains the United States and Canada, although the Timex brand is sold worldwide due to its ability to capitalize on its strong brand image and reputation for quality.
One of the most successful and important features available on many Timex watches is the Indiglo backlight system. Indiglo is a brand name of Indiglo Corporation, solely owned by Timex for licensing purposes. Timex electroluminescent lamps, branded Indiglo, were introduced in 1992 in the Ironman watch line. They were an immediate success. The Indiglo lamp uniformly lights the surface of the Timexs watch dials in a manner that makes the dial read very easily in many different light settings. In some newer watches the Indiglo backlight only lights up the numbers, rather than the entire LCD display, which is achieved by means of a specialized film that inverts the LCD transmissivity.
Today, Timex Group products are manufactured in the Far East and in Switzerland often based on technology that continues to be developed in the United States and in Germany. With a large and varied line of watches, Timex has the style for everyone. From the locker room to the board room, there is a great Timex style time-piece for you.",B00284C9NW,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/21vUhlnGJsL._SR38,50_.jpg']",['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/21vUhlnGJsL.jpg'],Boys Watches

The company has remained very competitive and the Timex brand continues its dominance through present day. Its primary market remains the United States and Canada, although the Timex brand is sold worldwide due to its ability to capitalize on its strong brand image and reputation for quality.
One of the most successful and important features available on many Timex watches is the Indiglo backlight system. Indiglo is a brand name of Indiglo Corporation, solely owned by Timex for licensing purposes. Timex electroluminescent lamps, branded Indiglo, were introduced in 1992 in the Ironman watch line. They were an immediate success. The Indiglo lamp uniformly lights the surface of the Timexs watch dials in a manner that makes the dial read very easily in many different light settings. In some newer watches the Indiglo backlight only lights up the numbers, rather than the entire LCD display, which is achieved by means of a specialized film that inverts the LCD transmissivity.
Today, Timex Group products are manufactured in the Far East and in Switzerland often based on technology that continues to be developed in the United States and in Germany. With a large and varied line of watches, Timex has the style for everyone.

Timex will not repair defects relating to servicing not performed by Timex Corporation. This limited warranty applies to US Customers.

Timex Group B.V. is one of the best-known American watch companies. Timex's U.S. headquarters are located in Middlebury Connecticut and it has substantial operations in China, the Philippines and India and full scale sales companies in Canada, the UK, France and Mexico.
The company began in 1854 as Waterbury Clock in Connecticut's Naugatuck Valley, known during the nineteenth century as the ""Switzerland of America."" Sister company Waterbury Watch manufactured the first inexpensive mechanical pocket watch in 1880. During World War I, Waterbury began making wristwatches, which had only just become popular, and in 1933 it made history by creating the first Mickey Mouse clock under license from Walt Disney, with Mickey's hands pointing the time.
During World War II, Waterbury renamed itself U.S. Time Company. In 1950 the company introduced a wristwatch called the Timex. Over the next three decades, Timex was sold through a series of advertisements which emphasized its durability by putting the watch through ""torture tests,"" such as falling over the Grand Coulee Dam or being strapped to the propeller of an outboard motor, with the slogan ""It takes a licking and keeps on ticking."" With the help of former Olympic broadcaster, spokesman John Cameron Swayze, sales took off. The company later became Timex Corporation, then Timex Group and, to date, has sold over one billion watches.
The company has remained very competitive and the Timex brand continues its dominance through present day. Its primary market remains the United States and Canada, although the Timex brand is sold worldwide due to its ability to capitalize on its strong brand image and reputation for quality.

With the launch of its first watch in November 1974, Casio entered the wristwatch market at a time when the watch industry had just discovered digital technology. As a company with cutting-edge electronic technology developed for pocket calculators, Casio entered this field confident that it could develop timepieces that would lead the market.
Today, Casio is focusing its efforts on solar-powered radio-controlled watches: the built-in solar battery eliminates the nuisance of replacing batteries, atomic timekeeping means the users never have to reset the time. Recently, Casio launched a series of Bluetooth watches that sync to the users cell phone to automatically update the time.

It has come a long way over the past decades-from a small carpenter's workshop to a modern, global enterprise. The LEGO Group is a privately held company based in Billund, Denmark. The company is still owned by the Kirk Kristiansen family, who founded it in 1932.
The LEGO Group is engaged in the development of children's creativity through playing and learning, and it is this core philosophy that is built into every LEGO brand watch and clock.
Perfect for young or old Star Wars fans, the LEGO Star Wars Luke Skywalker kids' watch features a fun, colorful dial with an image of LEGO Luke Skywalker and his lightsaber in front of an intergalactic scene. This watch comes with multi-coloured, interchangeable links and an easy-to-read watch face that is not only exciting but also comfortable and durable. This LEGO watch comes with accessories, which offer plenty of design possibilities.

These watches are brought to you by Viva Time Corporation. Viva Time Corporation was founded over 30 years ago to fill a void in the timepiece marketplace. What began as a small specialty watch company has since grown into a significant, multi-brand manufacturer and marketer of fashion watches.
In the 1970s the watch market was divided by two widely divergent ends of the product spectrum. There were traditional watches that were inexpensive and lacked style, and at the opposite end were the luxury timepieces from Switzerland which were stylish, dependable, but most notably, expensive.",B005PYHC4S,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/2198brkChgL._SR38,50_.jpg']",['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/2198brkChgL.jpg'],Boys Watches

Wrist Watches","AL23000 Color: Blue Features: -Material: Polyurethane. -Face diameter: 1.48''. Gender: -Women's Watches. Style: -Children's Watches. Band Material: -Plastic. Watch Color: -Black.

The end of the 1990s marked the most recent stage of evolution at Alessi. At the end of a process of development and evolution lasting approximately thirty years, the “Dream Factory” has turned from a more or less traditional industrial company into a “research laboratory in the field of applied arts”.
The millennium has witnessed extensive new developments at Alessi. Collaborations have been formed with other companies in manufacturing contexts very different from Alessi’s original dedication to small objects for the home and kitchen. The company offers its skills in design management and its vision of design as a global creative discipline to companies operating in product spheres unconnected with its original domestic field.
Alessi’s aim is to give life to new objects characterised by that mix of eccentricity and style, playfulness and culture, irony and elegance which has become synonymous with the Alessi name. One of the first licensing projects run by Alessi was “Alessi Watches”, with a launch that took place with the 2002 collection. But this part of the company history goes further back, to the 1980s, when two of the most famous architects who had already designed successful products for the Crusinallo-based factory were invited to work on the wristwatch theme: Achille Castiglioni and Aldo Rossi. The latter created “Momento”, a new version of which is presently included in the catalogue, while Achille Castiglioni designed “Record”, of which the present collection also includes a chronograph version.
Every year the “Alessi Watches” collection ushers new additions. Ettore Sottsass designed “Ciclo” with a large crown, a dial in bright colours, and well-defined white graphics, typical of his design approach. Andrea Branzi had fun playing with the hour numerals, placing them in new and eccentric positions on or off the dial, along the crown. Indeed, the name “Out_time” is clearly evocative of the project style. The Dutch designer Wiel Arets created “watch.it”, with a strap in steel or brown leather, a matte white face, and the hours marked as if they were tiny beads of water.
Miriam Mirri designed four wristwatches for the “Alessi Watches” range. “Mariposa” – “butterfly” in Spanish – in two variants, with a white or blue dial; “Millennium”, in aluminium in grey, red and violet with a leather strap to create a new light and practical combinations.

Casio
With the launch of its first watch in November 1974, Casio entered the wristwatch market at a time when the watch industry had just discovered digital technology. As a company with cutting-edge electronic technology developed for pocket calculators, Casio entered this field confident that it could develop timepieces that would lead the market.
Today, Casio is focusing its efforts on solar-powered radio-controlled watches: the built-in solar battery eliminates the nuisance of replacing batteries, atomic timekeeping means the users never have to reset the time. Recently, Casio launched a series of Bluetooth watches that sync to the users cell phone to automatically update the time. Casio is always moving time forward.",B0099QJ52U,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/413f-XZKzEL._SR38,50_.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/314QfEjy6HL._SR38,50_.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/21znsxYyQZL._SR38,50_.jpg']","['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/413f-XZKzEL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/314QfEjy6HL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/21znsxYyQZL.jpg']",Boys Watches

The character first appeared in Detective Comics #27 (May 1939), and since then has appeared primarily in publications by DC Comics. Originally referred to as ""The Bat-Man"" and still referred to at times as ""The Batman"", he is additionally known as ""The Caped Crusader"", ""The Dark Knight"",  and ""The World's Greatest Detective,"" among other titles.
In the original version of the story and the vast majority of retellings, Batman's secret identity is Bruce Wayne, an American millionaire (later billionaire) playboy, industrialist, and philanthropist. Having witnessed the murder of his parents as a child, he swore revenge on criminals, an oath tempered with the greater ideal of justice. Wayne trains himself both physically and intellectually and dons a bat-themed costume in order to fight crime. Batman operates in the fictional American Gotham City, assisted by various supporting characters including his crime-fighting partner, Robin, his butler Alfred Pennyworth, the police commissioner Jim Gordon, and occasionally the heroine Batgirl. He fights an assortment of villains such as the Joker, the Penguin, the Riddler, Two-Face, Poison Ivy and Cat woman. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers; he makes use of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, martial arts skills, an indomitable will, fear, and intimidation in his continuous war on crime.
Batman became a very popular character soon after his introduction and gained his own comic book title, Batman, in 1940. As the decades wore on, differing interpretations of the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series used a camp aesthetic which continued to be associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in the 1986 miniseries The Dark Knight Returns, by Frank Miller, while the successes of Tim Burton's 1989 film Batman and Christopher Nolan's 2005 reboot Batman Begins also helped to reignite popular interest in the character. A cultural icon, Batman has been licensed and adapted into a variety of media, from radio to television and film, and appears on a variety of merchandise sold all over the world such as toys and video games. The character has also intrigued psychiatrists with many trying to understand the character's psyche and his true ego in society. In May 2011, Batman placed second on IGN's Top 100 Comic Book Heroes of All Time, after Superman. Empire magazine also listed him second in their 50 Greatest Comic Book Characters of All Time.

Casio
With the launch of its first watch in November 1974, Casio entered the wristwatch market at a time when the watch industry had just discovered digital technology. As a company with cutting-edge electronic technology developed for pocket calculators, Casio entered this field confident that it could develop timepieces that would lead the market.
Today, Casio is focusing its efforts on solar-powered radio-controlled watches: the built-in solar battery eliminates the nuisance of replacing batteries, atomic timekeeping means the users never have to reset the time. Recently, Casio launched a series of Bluetooth watches that sync to the users cell phone to automatically update the time. Casio is always moving time forward.",B00AC7G7IU,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31FGTxfOruL._SR38,50_.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41SjOUWhe9L._SR38,50_.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31MpUA8mLjL._SR38,50_.jpg']","['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31FGTxfOruL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41SjOUWhe9L.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31MpUA8mLjL.jpg']",Boys Watches

Mickey Mouse is synonymous with Disney, and that’s because he’s their official mascot. But cartoon Mickey (who was originally named Mortimer!) has plenty of characters to keep him company thanks to Walt Disney Studios. Its prolific animated feature films have captured the imagination of children from one to 92 for decades.
Located in Burbank, California, the enormous media corporation of today began back in 1923 by the Disney brothers, Walt and Roy. They first started producing silent movies, but by 1928, the famous Steamboat Willie, starring Mickey Mouse, began the tradition of synchronized sound. By 1929 the fun-loving mouse was a comic strip and soon thereafter the brothers were making color movies.
Before long the popular feature-length animations like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Bambi and Cinderella were created. 1950 saw the first completely live-action feature, Treasure Island and Disney’s foray into television, which was a complete success. The long-running series, Disneyland, began a relationship with the ABC network that is now owned by Disney. This TV series was the inspiration for the theme parks, 14 of which exist today around the world.
Walt Disney died in 1966 and Roy took over, releasing The Aristocats in 1970 as the first animated film without his brother’s input. Thankfully, the movie was a big hit. But by 1971 Roy also died, and the control of the company went to Walt’s son-in-law, Ron Miller, along with Donn Tatum and Card Walker. Through the 1970s and 1980s, there were many partnerships and the brand diversified.
Michael Eisner became the CEO in 1984 and broadened the company’s holdings. He kept his post until Robert Iger took over in 2005. Disney now owns and operates within the following industries: entertainment, theme parks and resorts, consumer products and media networks. Who knew one mouse and two imaginative brothers could create such a longstanding empire?",B00AQCW51O,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/21xpR4YN-qL._SR38,50_.jpg']",['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/21xpR4YN-qL.jpg'],Boys Watches

Casio
With the launch of its first watch in November 1974, Casio entered the wristwatch market at a time when the watch industry had just discovered digital technology. As a company with cutting-edge electronic technology developed for pocket calculators, Casio entered this field confident that it could develop timepieces that would lead the market.
Today, Casio is focusing its efforts on solar-powered radio-controlled watches: the built-in solar battery eliminates the nuisance of replacing batteries, atomic timekeeping means the users never have to reset the time. Recently, Casio launched a series of Bluetooth watches that sync to the users cell phone to automatically update the time.

Timex Group B.V. is one of the best-known American watch companies. Timex's U.S. headquarters are located in Middlebury Connecticut and it has substantial operations in China, the Philippines and India and full scale sales companies in Canada, the UK, France and Mexico.
The company began in 1854 as Waterbury Clock in Connecticut's Naugatuck Valley, known during the nineteenth century as the ""Switzerland of America."" Sister company Waterbury Watch manufactured the first inexpensive mechanical pocket watch in 1880. During World War I, Waterbury began making wristwatches, which had only just become popular, and in 1933 it made history by creating the first Mickey Mouse clock under license from Walt Disney, with Mickey's hands pointing the time.
During World War II, Waterbury renamed itself U.S. Time Company. In 1950 the company introduced a wristwatch called the Timex. Over the next three decades, Timex was sold through a series of advertisements which emphasized its durability by putting the watch through ""torture tests,"" such as falling over the Grand Coulee Dam or being strapped to the propeller of an outboard motor, with the slogan ""It takes a licking and keeps on ticking."" With the help of former Olympic broadcaster, spokesman John Cameron Swayze, sales took off. The company later became Timex Corporation, then Timex Group and, to date, has sold over one billion watches.
The company has remained very competitive and the Timex brand continues its dominance through present day. Its primary market remains the United States and Canada, although the Timex brand is sold worldwide due to its ability to capitalize on its strong brand image and reputation for quality.
One of the most successful and important features available on many Timex watches is the Indiglo backlight system. Indiglo is a brand name of Indiglo Corporation, solely owned by Timex for licensing purposes. Timex electroluminescent lamps, branded Indiglo, were introduced in 1992 in the Ironman watch line. They were an immediate success. The Indiglo lamp uniformly lights the surface of the Timex’s watch dials in a manner that makes the dial read very easily in many different light settings. In some newer watches the Indiglo backlight only lights up the numbers, rather than the entire LCD display, which is achieved by means of a specialized film that inverts the LCD transmissivity.
Today, Timex Group products are manufactured in the Far East and in Switzerland often based on technology that continues to be developed in the United States and in Germany. With a large and varied line of watches, Timex has the style for everyone. From the locker room to the board room, there is a great Timex style time-piece for you.",B00BF77SX4,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/217QTTkn0WL._SR38,50_.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41kwjbEwAfL._SR38,50_.jpg']","['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/217QTTkn0WL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41kwjbEwAfL.jpg']",Boys Watches

Casio
With the launch of its first watch in November 1974, Casio entered the wristwatch market at a time when the watch industry had just discovered digital technology. As a company with cutting-edge electronic technology developed for pocket calculators, Casio entered this field confident that it could develop timepieces that would lead the market.
Today, Casio is focusing its efforts on solar-powered radio-controlled watches: the built-in solar battery eliminates the nuisance of replacing batteries, atomic timekeeping means the users never have to reset the time. Recently, Casio launched a series of Bluetooth watches that sync to the users cell phone to automatically update the time.

The name ‘LEGO’ is an abbreviation of the two Danish words “leg godt”, meaning “play well”. It’s our name and it’s our ideal.
The LEGO Group was founded in 1932 by Ole Kirk Christiansen. The Company has passed from father to son and remains a family owned business even today: Owned by Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen, a grandchild of the founder.
It has come a long way over the past almost 80 years – from a small carpenter’s workshop to a modern, global enterprise.
The LEGO Group is a privately held company based in Billund, Denmark. The company is still owned by the Kirk Kristiansen family who founded it in 1932.
The LEGO Group is engaged in the development of children’s creativity through playing and learning and it is this core philosophy that is built into every LEGO brand watch and clock.",B00CD375Z0,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51QXmfGwjnL._SR38,50_.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/319AbvXO8tL._SR38,50_.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/515PpByoXDL._SR38,50_.jpg']","['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51QXmfGwjnL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/319AbvXO8tL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/515PpByoXDL.jpg']",Boys Watches

2.4 ounces","The Marvel Story
Marvel has gone through several incarnations with various names, but started out as Timely Publications in 1939, founded by Martin Goodman. By the early 1950s the name changed to Atlas Comics. In 1961, with the introduction of the famous Fantastic Four, Marvel Comics began using its best-known name.
The first superhero was the Human Torch, and since every superhero needs a super villain, this niche was filled by Namor the Sub-Mariner (who later became an on-again, off-again hero). A resounding success, the first issue needed a second printing and together, they sold almost 900,000 copies.
Soon thereafter, writer Joe Simon and artist Jack Kirby created the patriotic Captain America during World War II, a character still popular today. Stanley Lieber, known more widely as Stan Lee (his pseudonym that he eventually adopted as his legal name) joined Timely and went on writing comic books for decades.
By the 1960s, well-known heroes and antiheroes emerged, including the Hulk, Spider-Man, Thor, Iron Man, and the X-Men. This is the time Steve Ditko joined the brand, now known as Marvel Comics. These characters, with real life flaws and problems, revolutionized the comic book world because they were relatable to readers. By 1968, Marvel was selling 50 million comic books per year.
The late 1970s saw the long-running Star Wars series, and the 1980s made money with Daredevil, but the real resurgence of comic books came in the early 1990s. Marvel began selling trading cards and using more crossovers in the fictional Marvel Universe. But the 90s proved to be a tough time for Marvel, with defecting artists and a Chapter 11 filing. The company was saved and renamed Marvel Enterprises.
The new millennium gave way to diversification, including the wildly successful film franchises, most notably the X-Men and Spider-Man series, with characters slightly updated to reflect current trends. Marvel also launched a digital archive of over 2,500 back issues, viewed for a fee. Now Marvel is owned by The Walt Disney Company and is still going strong. Superhero strong.

Batman is a fictional character, a comic book superhero created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger. The character first appeared in Detective Comics #27 (May 1939), and since then has appeared primarily in publications by DC Comics. Originally referred to as ""The Bat-Man"" and still referred to at times as ""The Batman"", he is additionally known as ""The Caped Crusader"", ""The Dark Knight"", and ""The World's Greatest Detective,"" among other titles.
In the original version of the story and the vast majority of retellings, Batman's secret identity is Bruce Wayne, an American millionaire (later billionaire) playboy, industrialist, and philanthropist. Having witnessed the murder of his parents as a child, he swore revenge on criminals, an oath tempered with the greater ideal of justice. Wayne trains himself both physically and intellectually and dons a bat-themed costume in order to fight crime. Batman operates in the fictional American Gotham City, assisted by various supporting characters including his crime-fighting partner, Robin, his butler Alfred Pennyworth, the police commissioner Jim Gordon, and occasionally the heroine Batgirl. He fights an assortment of villains such as the Joker, the Penguin, the Riddler, Two-Face, Poison Ivy and Cat woman. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any superpowers; he makes use of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, martial arts skills, an indomitable will, fear, and intimidation in his continuous war on crime.
Batman became a very popular character soon after his introduction and gained his own comic book title, Batman, in 1940. As the decades wore on, differing interpretations of the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series used a camp aesthetic which continued to be associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in the 1986 miniseries The Dark Knight Returns, by Frank Miller, while the successes of Tim Burton's 1989 film Batman and Christopher Nolan's 2005 reboot Batman Begins also helped to reignite popular interest in the character. A cultural icon, Batman has been licensed and adapted into a variety of media, from radio to television and film, and appears on a variety of merchandise sold all over the world such as toys and video games. The character has also intrigued psychiatrists with many trying to understand the character's psyche and his true ego in society. In May 2011, Batman placed second on IGN's Top 100 Comic Book Heroes of All Time, after Superman. Empire magazine also listed him second in their 50 Greatest Comic Book Characters of All Time.",B00DHL0ENC,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/21xevc8%2BT7L._SR38,50_.jpg']",['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/21xevc8%2BT7L.jpg'],Boys Watches
