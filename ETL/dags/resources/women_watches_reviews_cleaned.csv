What a clean looking...uncomplicated watch...adjusts to your wrist in seconds...anyone can do it.  No need to go to a jeweler.  The little stones at the hour hands are so sparkely...a nice little pick you up for those winter months.  Treat yourself.,Great little watch,5.0,B0000643Q6
"- Price point was excellent

- Product Quality is really good

- Shipped on time

- Was priced 50% compared to Dillard's locally and no taxes, no shipping fees:)",Great buy!,5.0,B0000643Q6
I bought this for almost 50% less than it sells in the local department store and am happy with my purchase.  The only trouble I have had is with the clasp.  It is a little tricky and you have to make sure that is catches correctly.  I found my watch on the floor recently because the clasp came open.,Very Satisfied,4.0,B0000643Q6
"It's not the most expensive watch but it doesn't have to be. It's a looker of a watch. Classy,clean and sharp looking. Mesh band on the wrist (any- I have a Skagen also) is most comfortable and easy to use and sure locking. Terrific buy & price.",Classy Watch,5.0,B0000643Q6
"I bought this as my everyday watch and love it!  I'm very happy with the ultrathin band that lays down nicely on my wrist and doesn't catch at my arm hairs like chain links do.  The only complaint, and this is a very minor one, is that the adjustable band wasn't made for someone who's wrist is as thin as mine- 5.5 inches around.  I think the tightest it'll go is 6 inches.",Very versatile- can be elegant or casual,5.0,B0000643Q6
"The watch is extremely reliable. I've had it three years and it's never lost time and is running on the original battery. I wear it every day so it takes a lot of abuse. It's simple design is elegant enough for me to wear to work or out for a casual evening, but casual enough for me to wear on weekends. The mesh band is the most comfortable band you will ever wear, you don't even feel it against your skin. I have a two-tone Movado and I far prefer my $89 Skagen to my $900 Movado.  My Skagen is also easy to read the time. I just love it more than I can say. I own numerous watches, many from Switzerland. But the Skagen is the KING of my lifetime watch collection.

"I purchased this watch in December 2012 for myself as a Christmas present.  I needed a silver watch to match other silver jewelry and this one was very pretty.  I'd heard that the Skagen brand was very dependable, but I have found this to not be the case.  The watch was only used one time , this year in fact.  I had a new battery installed and it ran for about 2 hours.  I found that if I continued to shake it, it would run but as soon as I stopped it stopped after about 30 minutes.  The jewelry repair rep had me bring it back to see if the connections were meeting and they were.  The screw to wound the watch is so tiny I could barely grasp it.  Imagine trying to keep it set...smh!  The clasp is difficult to latch but that wouldn't be a problem if there weren't so many other problems.  The watch is a waste of money and I will never buy another one.",Looks are very much deceiving!!!,1.0,B0000643Q6

"I purchased this becuase I really liked the adjustable band, the relative thinness, and the style.

I did so in spite of a few negative reviews that mentioned a bad clasp.  I adjusted the wristband and was very pleased with the fit- however I walked outside and it fell off while I took off a bag from around my arm.  I then realized that I (and I expect other users) had not properly fastened on the part of the clasp that holds the clasp fixed (ir there are 2 ways that you can put on the clasp- one that works well and one that doesn't).

When properly placed, the clasp works well.  Unfortunately- a marked the face on the watch on its crash.... But I still like the watch alot.",The clasp noted by other reviewers has a lock position,4.0,B0000643Q6

"I purchased the Skagen women's watch and loved it.  It was attractive looking and kept perfect time.  Everything was fine until I had to replace the battery.  It started out easily enough, with my purchase of a new battery for a mere $1.28.  The kicker came when I tried to re-attach the back cover.  It was virtually impossible to snap it back on.  After doing some research online, I found that most people had the same problem.  The only solution was to either go to a jewelry repair and pay who knows what or to buy a commercial press at a cost of about $15.00.  How reasonable is it to buy a $60 watch and pay almost a third of the cost just to secure the cover on the watch.  If I had known that beforehand, I never would have made the purchase.  How disappointing!",Great watch with a major hitch,4.0,B0000643Q6

"I love Skagen watches and have one that is still going strong after almost 20 years.  I wanted a new watch and this one was perfect for my requirements.  The latch is great and I have never had any Skagen watch fall off if I closed it correctly.  I discussed the battery usage issue with my jeweler and he says batteries are not made to last as long as they used to.

My only complaint with this watch is the stem is smooth and that makes it difficult to change the time.  I have to use a quilting needle grabber to hold stem when I turn it.

I will buy another Skagen, but I will look very closely at the picture to see what the stem looks like.",Love this watch,4.0,B0000643Q6

Overall it's perfect for her line of work in the medical world.

UPDATE _____
So my the battery seemed to die after having the watch for about 5 months (!!!!) which was pretty aggravating to begin with on such a seemingly high quality item.
Took it to a jeweler and Skagen dealer who replaced it for a small fee. Now, the watch doesn't keep proper time. Not even close.
Skagen has a warranty policy but they require you to ship them the watch along with your credit card. They get to decide what to do with both and you get to wait with baited breath to see what happens.
Why would I do such a thing for a $100 item? Crazy sauce!

"The title says it all.  Initially, one crystal fell out and blocked the hands from moving.  I had that repaired and then it happened again with several of the crystals. Otherwise it would have been a good watch.  I then tried a different Skagen without the crystals but within the first month the pin fell out and and fell right off my wrist.",Crystals fall out and impede hand movement,1.0,B0000643Q6
"it is not what I expected from a Skagen.  The casing is very thick and looks like a cheap imitation. Not to mention the watch arrived with a broken stem so I can't set the time.  It was a real disappointment, and I intend of course to return it for a FULL REFUND.
The reason I wanted to purchase another Skagen watch when my band broke on my other watch, is that I liked the look.  My previous Skagen watch works fine, except for the broken band.  Unfortunately, I was told by several jewelers whom I asked about fixing the watch that it would cost me about the price of a new one to fix the old b/c Skagen sold the company and the new owners have TERRIBLE customer service.

In short, this watch is not what I had hoped for.  There is nothing unique or interesting about it.  The key feature, for me, that commends the Skagen brand is its thin, sleek casing.  Clearly that is no longer the case, at least not with this particular model.  Not sure if they no longer manufacture that line anymore.  But absent the sleek look, I will select another brand and one that I know I can service without hassle.  I was willing to take the risk with Skagen, but now after seeing the watch I don't want to go this route and will select another brand that appeals to me, and one whose manufacturer stands 100% behind their brand and their product.

"The watch is beautiful! Unfortunately, the one I received had a malfunctioning knob for adjusting the time. I didn't mind that because things happen.

I had trouble getting through on the seller's website and had to go through Amazon.

The what overall is pretty nice.  Skagen is a good quality watch.  the problem with this one is the clasp.

"The battery of my regular Timex Indiglo watch died while I was traveling internationally, so I needed a replacement, quick.  I ducked into a Duty Free shop, expecting to have to pay a lot.  When the sales person showed me two versions of this watch, one with a black face, one with a gold face, for only $10, I was intrigued.  I picked the gold, which I find very easy to read.  I was worried that the black one would become invisible in dim light.  I get compliments whenever I wear this watch - no one believes it was so inexpensive.  Disclaimer: I am female and prefer a man's watch. While this one is the same size as my Timex, it is thinner, lighter, more comfortable, and more elegant so I am very pleased with it.

"I was looking for a digital watch that had a face that wouldn't catch on clothing, or anything else, and had a rubber (polyurethane) strap that wouldn't absorb smelly sweat after I went running.

The polyurethane wrist strap  is smooth on the skin, doesn't absorb sweat, easy to rinse, and durable. The indiglo light is bright and the watch is easy to read.

"This watch has a nice heft to it, which is a really silly word to type but is the accurate word. Part of its heft, however, is the humongous band size. First, the specs for this watch say the band size is womens standard, though the reviewers with well-endowed wrists have penned loving reviews for finally making a large enough band. The disparacy here is confusing. Let me assure you, this watch has a humongous band. It would hang loose on my ankle, and I have thick ankles (though they connect my legs to my feet just fine thank you). So, the task is to take it to a jeweler. This would be fine if my town had a friendly jeweler who didn't immediately shoo me toward the door because not only is it a piddly Timex, but a piddly Timex I didn't (couldnt if I wanted to) buy it from them.

"Just wanted to write a quick review to tell everyone how beautiful and practical this delicate watch is.
I have owned this exact watch for about two years now, without battery replacement (and yes I've accidently worn it in the shower a few times, though I wouldn't recommend it)  It is lovely, and awesome.  A great every day watch for a feminine, somewhat old fashioned look.  I love it.  I own antique 14k gold watches, but this is my everyday watch.

I ordered a new one, because I abused my watch a little bit and lost a crystal.  So now I'll have one for everyday at home, and one for everyday going out.  Silly I know, but the old is still taking a licking and keeps on ticking, in the old words of Cameron Swayze.

"I have had many Timex watches and I love expansion band watches particularly those that look feminine and not industrial.  I wear my watch all day, everywhere but in the shower and I appreciate how easy the expansion band allows me to remove and replace my watch.  The face has a pretty pearlized look and the crystals above and below the face make it look dressy.  My only complaint is that the pearlized surface on the face  creates lines from the center outward.  Too frequently, it is difficult to distinguish the line caused by the face from the hand of the watch.  I have to pick up the face and  move it about in the light to read it which is rather a pain.

"This watch is utterly handsome and elegant.  It is the perfect size for what I wanted, not thin and delicate, nor clunky and large.  I wanted a watch that was simple, beautiful, and rich looking and this is it.  Over the past 15 years, I've purchased less expensive watches for about $125 and was always disappointed that they never lasted.  Then I was advised to up my price and pay a little more for quality.

"I actually liked the watch when I got it but I dropped it and the crystal cracked. I've dropped watches before and never had a crystal crack before but I took it to my watch repairman and he told me that he will not work on this brand because they use a very thin crystal. I investigated the warranty but it doesn't cover the crystal and purchasing a replacement crystal through Skagen or a repair store that would repair it was going to cost about $40 and given how easily it breaks I decided not to pour more money into it.
I have to say that although it was past the return date, Amazon went above and beyond to make me happy, so my rating for Amazon is good, but I will not purchase a Skagen watch again.

"I love the look of this watch.  It's simple, the perfect size, and has an extremely low profile face.
However, the pin on one of the latches kept falling out, so almost every day before putting it on, I would have to reassemble 3 tiny pieces.
I tried taking it to several jewelry stores, but no one will work on a Skagen.  It has to be sent back to the manufacturer for any repairs.  The warranty only covers the watch itself - not the band or clasp.
Ultimately, after wearing it perhaps 20 different times, the band busted right where it attaches to the watch face.
I called Skagen, and since the band isn't covered by warranty, I could ship it to them and pay approx $35 to have it fixed.

- Not too good for a small hand. Though it is possible to adjust the bracelet to different sizes, on a small hand there will be a long part of the band left (under the ""top layer""). It is difficult to make this part invisible, as it tends to come from one of the sides.

- The clasp is tight. Hope it will be easier to open and close after some usage.

my watch kept stopping, thought it was the batterey, changed it but still no change, i will be sending it back, will let you know what service i get, if negative or possitive will let you know, as for the rest of my skagen watches, i have not really tested them as this one as i wear them for a day or so and put it away.

 but i still say if you are looking for a really gentlemanly classy quality look watch that will not break the bank this is it. any skagen watch.

"It's elegant, chic, and therefore looks as good on a woman's wrist as it does a man's.  In fact, I bought it for my wife because most women's watches are too dainty by today's fashion standard.  The adjustment of the mesh band makes it possible to wrap it around a wrist of any size.  The face is sufficiently large to deliver a power statement on a woman's wrist, without being overwhelming.  The larger face makes it easier to read time, however; the tiny date numbers are too small to read, and are therefore superfluous.",Great Women's Watch,5.0,B0001HIT1O

"This is a very light-weight, slim and attractive watch. The hands are thin and elegant... overall very happy with it. The only down-side: this, like ALL Skagen watches I've ever purchased, came with a defective clasp. It's a fairly simply task to bend a small piece of metal on the clasp to get it to engage properly and thus keep the band securely in place and the clasp in the closed position. I pretty much just count on having some needle-nose pliers handy whenever a new Skagen watch arrives. This is the only thing keeping me from rating this watch at five stars.","very nice watch, beware band clasp",4.0,B0001HIT1O

"I purchased this watch after seeing Skagen watches in local showrooms, with the specs for this watch show water resistant at 99 feet also special features in the specs shown as water resistant, which we required as it was intended to be used for light swimming.
When the watch arrived my wife set up the local time and starting wearing it immediately,but fortunately not using it for swimming, when opening the accompanying user manual we noticed it listed water proof ratings and said that watches stamped  3ATM could  not be used for swimming and on looking at the stamp on this watch it was clearly marked 3ATM which is far different o what the sales specification shows.
As my wife had been wearing the watch it made it impossible to return it even though Amazon said it could be returned ,it would have been a bit difficult as all the packaging had been destroyed, so we are left with nothing but a very nice dress watch and not a watch that can be used for swimming.",Nice watch,3.0,B0001HIT1O
"After spending quite a lot of time searching for a watch I purchased the Skagen in June 2012. I liked its elegant, simple, light styling. Even the packaging is classy. Amazon's price was significantly less than elsewhere. The first watch I received was broken out of the box--the date adjustment did not work. Amazon quickly sent me a replacement that worked well. I received a lot of compliments. It looks like a more expensive watch, but it is not gaudy. It is easy to put on and comfortable.
The watch, unfortunately, has a few problems: the date window and the date are small making it slightly difficult to read unless you have perfect vision, the crown is so small that the date is a little difficult to adjust, and in March 2013 the date adjustment stopped working. The watch mechanism has a limited lifetime warranty, but I have to return it with an $8.50 shipping and handling fee, and wait 4 to 6 weeks for the watch to be repaired and returned. If the style suits you it is a nice watch for the money, but it does not have the best quality mechanism.",Elegant but has problems,3.0,B0001HIT1O
"Really pretty watch, but regardless of having it adjusted more than once at fine Jewelry store, comes unclasped and falls off, usually before I walk out the door, so I don't wear it as much as I'd like to.

"The reason I gave it 5 stars because 1st I like the design and 2nd it's good bang for the buck. The dial is less detailed, simple and sober; great combination of two colors (gold and steel). The dial is very reflective that automatically absorbs and reflects the colors of your surroundings, such as your clothes or so; not too much to be awkward, but to harmonize with your personality. In some picture the color of dial appears as white ""BUT ITS NO"" the color of the dial is pure steel. The bracelet is strong and along with the design of the dial makes it a piece of art-craft.

The watch itself is fine. Strap a bit long for a woman's watch, or maybe my wrist is too skinny?

"Easy to read, for something so small. I bought mine used, but in great condition. The watch I have, has very little, clicking sound.  I have to hold it close to my ear, to hear it. It appears, this may vary, from watch to watch; since others have reviewed this, so negatively. The band, looks like it will easily crack, if bent too many times; taking it on or off.  My other watches, with such straps, finally break. Requires, a very narrow wrist, to wear. Strap may last longer, if only go through one side, of the latch, and use the black strap, to hold any extra length, if there is any. since  the plastic band, is not bent to extremes, each time it is put on, or taken off.

Lovely watch my only issue was how tight it was on my wrist and I have a very petite wrist can't say that bout the rest of me (laugh) it left marks after wearing a day.

"This, in my opinion, is one of the prettiest watches in any price range. I've had this watch for around 4 years & it still looks like new.  It finally quit today, & I decided it would cost nearly as much as the watch to replace the battery.  It was about $22 at Target when I bought it.  Went looking and found the same watch, & it is just over $22 now.  I couldn't find one not already running so perhaps the battery won't last as long in this one.

However, when I read the information that came with the watch, I learned that not only is it not the least bit water resistant, but it is suggested to even take it off while washing dishes.

"The description that this watch band fits Casio G-Shock is incorrect. I purchased this item to replace the original 16-mm band of a Casio G-Shock Model DW-5600E (The Classic). The Timex TX16G14 does not properly fit this watch. The 16-mm width is correct but the recesses molded into the band where it inserts into the body of the watch (at the spring bars) are not large enough to properly seat the band. The spring bars can be forced into place but the watch band then rigidly sticks out on both sides of the watch in the same plane as the watch body, and doesn't wrap snugly around the wrist (i.e., there is a large gap between the band and one's wrist on either side of the watch body). Subsequent research on other websites show that the various G-Shock watches have specific fitments for the 16- and 18-mm bands. I recommend identifying the Casio model number for the band that properly fits your watch and order the original factory band (which is more expensive) instead of this generic ill-fitting item. I did so and the new replacement band (with Casio factory replacement band number 71601288) fits perfectly.",Does not fit all Casio G-Shock watches,1.0,B00024WAPW

The metal buckle is a plus too I suppose but I have not ever had a Casio buckle ever fail. The length says ""Men's standard"" and that may well be true but I found it very long. Of course this can only really be a good thing. I definitely would not want one too short and if it was too long then I can always cut some excess off; it is not required and it gives you options.

As for the pros of this band, it's comfortable and can hold even very large watches - I use it with my Seiko Monster and it seems that the band is big enough to hold a considerably larger watch.","Handy, but not so high quality",3.0,B00024WLAQ

"This product does not fit the Timex Data Link USB watch perfectly.  It is a generic band designed to fit almost any watch and so the watch has lost it's snug, handsome looks.  You see the data link series watch is of a peculiar design where the band is of a unique shape and cut so as to fit the groove of the watch itself.  This band, on the other hand, causes that band housing to hang out or protude over the band creating an unattractive appearance.  I have therefore relegated it to being worn just for sport and not for work or other show.  Mind you, it is clearly a much more durable band than the plastic variety which always breaks (I have been through 3 of those now).

"I know that 5 stars means ""I love it"", but I don't really LOVE it because, come on, it's just a watch band.  I LIKE it though, which would be only 4 stars, but I can't find anything that the watch band is lacking, so I'll give it 5 stars, but I still don't LOVE it in the sense of feeling a deep, emotional bond to it.  It's more of a feeling of warm liking and contentment at having made a good, sensible purchase.  I would buy it again, if that's any indication of the degree of liking that I have for the product.

As far as details of the product:  It is a little thick and padded, as others have noted, but not outrageously so.  The part without the buckle is about 11.5 cm long and the part with the buckle is about 7.4 cm (just the leather part, not including the buckle; including the buckle, it is about 8.6 cm).  It was a little stiff when I first put it on the watch, but it molded to my wrist after a couple days.  I expect it will hold up reasonably well.  It comes with the little toilet-paper-holder-like pins for attaching it to the watch, so I didn't have to worry about destroying the old ones when I took off the old watch band.

"I bought two of these to replace the bands on two of my wife's watches. The first thing I noticed is that they are adequately substantial, but the black surface is very thin. As I installed the bands, the exterior skin cracked with the bending required, showing the white material beneath. Also, the springs that hold the bands to the watch are not high quality. Of the four springs I used, one of them did not re-extend once it was compressed. I will post a pic if Amazon allows this. The non-expanding spring was basically useless, and I had to use the spring that had been on the previous band. For an everyday watch that you don't care too much about its appearance, it's a relatively good value.

""Long length"" is rather relative -- we needed to add three more links to this already longer-than-typical band. Our local jeweler only charged $3 for the matching links and the work.

I am concerned that the amount of pulling I have to do will weaken the links/clasp, not to mention that it's just plain frustrating trying to get the thing off.

Was just soaked in a rainstorm (watch was never submerged at all) and the next day I find condensation on the inside of the watch glass so bad that I could not read the face.

"I owned a Casio F105W-1A Illuminator identical to this one that I bought at Walmart at retail for $22 in 2011, *not* the $55 that this watch supposedly lists for. I wore it daily for over two years until the band tore from use. I wear my watches slightly tighter than most people do and this may have caused stress on the band. It kept time for another year until sporadically dying, so the battery life on this model was 3 1/2 years for me. That watch may have been sitting on the rack for years before I picked it up, which would explain the short battery life. Keeps time very well and loses maybe a couple minutes over several months. Classic Casio styling, the original F105W was released in 1995 or 1996 if I recall correctly.

The only issue I have with this Casio Illuminator I bought off Amazon is that the display is slightly weaker than I remember it being on my old one and the illumination function is somewhat less bright. This doesn't make the watch illegible by any means but it is something I've noticed. I hope it's not due to a weak battery that is going to die soon but so far after over six months it still works great. For $14 with free shipping the price can't be beat for a classic watch that should last you years.",Great watch with classic style,4.0,B00067KRVO

"I came to this site because I like this watch so much that I want a backup in case someone gets a wild hair to discontinue this model.  I agree with the other reviewers that this is a top choice for a basic functioning, dependable, and efficiently programmed watch.  Casio programmed this watch to function with minimum button pushes.  As with other reviewers, I wear this watch off-wrist, with me, on the inside of my trousers using a keychain hook or my western concho keychain linked with a nylon strap attached to the watch pin.  It is refreshing to find such a great design at such a reasonable price.  I side with the reviewer who drawers his Rolex and chooses function over form.  Much easier and less expensive to replace this watch than a Rolex, plus, this watch has more features than a typical Rolex.

- Abbreviated day and date (no month)
- Alarm Mode (one alarm only) and chime option
- 24 hour display conversion with single press of right side button
(No ""Timer"" mode.)
- Stainless steel back cover.
- Water Resistant - no depth indicated, but usually means to about 50 feet with most watches  (Interpreted to mean not suitable for swimming or diving, though that is merely my opinion based on my experience with other purchases).  Reviewer testimonies, including mine, however, attest to a high degree of durability and longevity.
- Automatic date and time adjust mode by simply pressing the ""Mode"" button (lower left side) three times which starts the seconds flashing for resetting time.  Another press returns the watch to normal display.  (You can reset the seconds, hour, minutes, day, and date, each separately.)
- Very light weight and thin compared to many watches, making it comfortable to wear or carry.

"This watch is a workhorse for endurance athletes and anyone who needs to keep track of lap/split times.  I've been through 5 of them in 14 years, and the only reason I replace them is the band breaks.  I found out after the first one that it's cheaper to get a new watch than to buy a band and have someone replace it.  Tried it myself, with no success.  Couldn't get the old band off without damaging the watch.  Now I just cut the bands off, put Velcro on the watch backs and stick 'em on my softball equipment bag, dashboard of my car, top of my surfboard, or any place else where it's useful to have a watch without wearing one.  The batteries last a long time and I've never replaced one.  Even had the display go blank once and was going to trash the watch, but after a few hours, it came back on!

My mother still wears hers every day and so did I until a couple of months ago. Unfortunately, I took it to a watch repair shop because water was fogging up the crystal. I also decided to have it cleaned (for the first time) and it hasn't worked right since. Mine still has the original band. Nobody could believe how old that watch was.

Being in the Navy for 20 years, having a watch that keeps accurate time was very important. My watch was always within a couple of seconds of the ship's official time.

We both had a good laugh when I was going through some old paperwork from my early Navy days and I came across the 3 year warranty paperwork for the watches.

"Our local retailers do not carry this classic design, so I was thrilled to find it online. Do be careful if you are looking for the older style clasp: this is NOT it. The video which displays the watch in its 360 degree glory shows the older model clasp (has adjustment notches built in as a great feature). This is the new style clasp which requires that the links be added/removed to adjust the band length.

I hesitated because I read the significant number of reviews here that claim the watch's clasp is not as sturdy or well made as they used to be.  But now that I went through with the purchase, I'm happy to report that the clasp on this present iteration of the Seiko SWZ058 watch is every bit as good as the one I bought in 1987.

When it stopped working recently and a new battery didn't fix it, I decided to look for a new one - I paid $138 for this, and it would have cost $125 for a cleaning, so it made sense to start new.  I had to have the band shortened, which a local jeweler did for $10.

It may be worn any time as its exquisite, ingenious two-tone design makes it a perfect adornment all the way from the beach to a formal reception.

"Our first Pulsar watch was bought nearly 30 yr. ago, has been worn almost daily and it still runs, although it shows exterior wear. The battery has been replaced about every 3 yr. From about 18 yr. ago and until about 3 yr. ago there was a Seiko outlet store near us and we bought other Pulsar and Seiko watches for the family. We have been very satisfied with the value, quality, style and reliability of Seiko watches. The reviewed purchase (SWZ056) is very similar in function and appearance to the 30 yr. old Pulsar, except for the face color (gold vs. white). The watch is sufficiently large to tell time easily, but not so large as to appear bulky. On viewing the photo of this watch on Amazon, we were initially concerned about ability to distinguish the gold hands on the gold face. While they are not as clearly visible as gold on white, differentiation is better than the Amazon picture reveals and it has not been a problem so far (1 month's use). (The preferred gold hands-on-white face was much more expensive!) The gold-silver styling of the SWZ056 watch enables it to be worn with gold or silver accessories and has a style suitable for daily or dress-up (but not formal) wear.

I've bought a LOT from Amazon over the years. This was the first watch though. I've bought and owned several SEIKO watches. This is probably the WORST experience that I've ever had with Amazon and Seiko too!

The watch came with a box that looked water damaged. The watch itself has a broken clasp. It looks beautiful,but I bought it as a gift.

When she opened it, the clasp refused to lock. Its never gone far enough to have the time set or even being tried on. Amazon actually tried to sleeze out of it by telling me to follow the waranty pocedures. How long does she have to wait for her Birthday gift? The warranty process could take weeks!",Beautiful; excellent time piece for a great price,5.0,B00068TJ30

"At first I thought I was sent the wrong watch because the gold is such a light color-- not at all the brassy gold in the picture. I even went back to my order to make sure it was filled correctly.  When I sat at my computer, near the window, to investigate my order further I saw that the gold was in there, but it is a VERY subtle color gold. I actually like this gold better than the overwhelming gold shown in the picture. I am giving it to my daughter today for her 30th birthday.

"As I was shopping for a new watch, I had a certain number of criteria in mind.

1.  It must be affordable
2.  It must be from a recognized brand (for quality purposes)
3.  It must be stylish without being too fad-ish
4.  It must be multi-purpose and lend itself to almost all
  styles of dress, be it casual or formal.

I found all of this in this little Seiko watch.  At first, I was setting my sights on a no-battery type of design, but after reading about both kinetic and solar watches...and finding out that both do require replacement of either a lithium ion battery or capacitor, neither of which were guaranteed to last longer than a regular battery operated watch...I decided to stick with the regular quartz.

The watch itself looks better than its picture.  The dial is listed as white on the website, but it's actually a silver tone...similar to what you see on Rolex brands (which it's supposed to mimic).  The gold has a nice shine to it, with particular sparkle coming from the marked hours and the pie-cut bezel around the watch face.  There is luminous material on the watch hands and hour markers, but a very minimal amount.  My guess is that they didn't want to detract from the shiny finish, but you do lose some ability to see the watch face at night.  There's enough to see the watch hands...just barely...but the hours are really hard to make out in the dark.  Oh well, if checking the time at night is a real issue then I suggest looking at some Timex Indiglos. ***REVISION*** While it is hard to see the luminous hands and markers at first, they do get brighter once your eyes adjust to the dark.  I found myself waking up early this morning and could clearly see all the marked hours and hands of my watch face with no problems.

This watch also comes with a day and date calendar.  Some have said it's hard to work, but I actually found it to be really easy.  The instructions are very easy to follow and I had the calendar and time set up in about 2 minutes.

This watch is surprisingly lightweight and very comfortable to wear.  The catch opens without breaking any nails off and the band is very roomy.  I have a medium to large sized wrist and wear my watch in a slightly loose ""bracelet"" style, but I still had to get a couple of links taken out.

My verdict:  a good watch at a good price.  It goes with everything in my closet and is from a company that's known for excellence and durablility.  Five Stars!

P.S. When I wrote this view, the price was not the same as what it's being sold for now. So my stance that it was very affordable was not untrue(as it was at the time).",Chic without being too pricey,5.0,B00068TIGI
"Nice looking watch, but unfortunately it did not come with an expansion band. My Sweetie wanted an expansion band. I did notice that the calendar was difficult to adjust, I had to read the manual for that to happen. A watch this simple should be more user friendly in setting. Unfortunately I had to return it, I have not found a replacement that looks as nice that has an expansion band.",bldimages,3.0,B00068TIGI

"In a nutshell-- the watch didn't work out of the box (wrong time, erratic-- fast? slow? hard to define but definitely not accurate.)

Qualified for the free repair, but when it finally came back from Asurion it was just as bad as before-- maybe different but still hours off in timekeeping on a daily basis. Now I don't qualify to send it back for a refund, send it back to be fixed-- stuck with a watch that doesn't tell time. Horrible situation, worst internet buying nightmare.

What if I had spent 20, 40 grand, instead of $156? I'd be devastated.

"I love this watch, I wear it all the time. I don't have to worry about ruining it because it's super waterproof.

Now however, I never leave the house without it! It looks great with everything, and it has the date, and hands and dots at each hour that glow in the dark :) My only only complaint about this watch is that it does have to be in contact with light to absorb some to glow, and the hands and dots stop glowing after about half an hour if not exposed to any more light. The pink face it not too overbearingly girly, it's almost more of a light salmon color really. This watch can be found with a white face too, I believe.

It is lightweight, flexible, attractive, and it has plenty of holes for fitting different sized wrists.  Usually, I have to punch an extra hole to get a correct fit, but not this band.  It fit just right with the standard holes. The ridges and texture of the underside allow air circulation to keep your wrist cool.

It was a bit of a challenge getting the old band off and this new one on.  After a little research, I realized that I needed a special tool to make the change-out easier.

"I finally bought this watch after some disasters with other cool designed watches that had no resistance to water. I chose it because it was listed as 100 meters water resistant but having received it I see that etched into the back it says it is only water resistant to 3 ATM which means, and I quote ""It is tested for water resistance up to 3 ATM, and must be able to survive 30 minutes under water at a depth of 1m (3 feet) followed by 90 seconds under a pressure corresponding to 30 meters"". I assume that this was a typo by Amazon or the vendor of the watch (IE 100 meters was listed instead of 100 feet). I have not tested to see if it holds up will in a shower but I won't expect it to survive unfortunately should I forget to take it off before hand. My last watch (The DUOTIC-D sold through a vender on Amazon) was 3 ATM (listed as water resistant 100ft...or 30 meters..well close enough). When I forgot to take it off before showering it let water in, leaving water spots on the inside of the glass. It then completely failed to work after water penetration a second time when I hand washed the dishes and forgot to take it off!!

This watch is made by a recognizable watch company rather than the Duotic,  which I have seen sold by under many different branded names and vendors, so I am hopeful it will survive as designed (IE 30 mins in 1 meter of water) but its certainly listed wrongly as being more water resistant that it really is. :-(....shame it looks so good.

I have gotten another watch to wear to work and am saving this one for my days off. UPDATE. The battery in this watch went dead on me so I purchased a new battery to replace it.  I have never seen any watch as difficult as this one to put a new battery in! I had to remove the watch band and 4 very tiny screws holding the back on to get inside and then the battery was under another covering and didn't just pop out. After finally getting the new battery in, it does not work.  I had the battery (purchased from Amazon) tested and it's fine. I don't understand why watch manufacturers don't make some attractive, economical, full featured digital watches for women. I am able to find many nice affordable watches for men but anything remotely close for women (if you can find it at all) is about five times more expensive. All I want is a digital watch with month/day/date and seconds that has a metal band and is reasonably good looking!  Is this too much to ask?!  I am not interested in a ""sporty"" chronograph styled watch. Why is it assumed that the average woman wants an analog watch and is not interested in a pretty and accurate digital timepiece?",Needs more features,4.0,B0000TIIIW
"Unfortunately, the ONLY women's digital dress watch available with both the date and a light.  Great appearance and features, however I am now on my third one.

"I had this watch for several years (sadly I just lost it, hence looking for a new watch).  I used it only for the gym, primarily for the chronograph + lap function to time my sets.  Never had a problem and hoped that I'd have it forever.

My only complaint was with the velcro strap.  While it was one of the reasons I chose the watch in the first place, it's a rather impractical design.  First, after a lot of use, it gets fuzz (and dust?) in it, and the end of the strap stops sticking so well, which is just annoying.  Second, when not it use, the velcro strap sticks to other things in my bag resulting in either (1) getting string/lint in the watch's strap (see above), or (2) snagging other items in my bag, such as a delicate shirt (that I had changed from after work).

Though the ""cons"" were annoying, I wouldn't pass up this watch because of them since it's hard to find a quality watch with these functions for a reasonable price.","Great watch, but the velcro strap doesn't last",4.0,B0000TIJ6S
"This watch is the BEST watch I have ever owned. There are several Timex Expedition watches that are the ""same"" but different. They are all great. Face colors, face sizes... etc., but the ""works"" of it are the same. The same because YOU CAN'T BEAT IT! I still have one that my father in law gave me because the face was scratched up. He owned it for two years, I had the battery replaced and it works to this day, which is 7 years later I might add.

You will have to have an excuse to replace this watch, so be warned... once you own one of these; it is hard to own others. Easy to read, alarms are awesome, great lighting; the bands never wear out and are comfortable for almost anyone. My skin is sensitive so the plastic bands laying on it give me rashes and irritations.

So, if you like the looks of these watches... I suggest you purchase it. And be prepared to like it all the way into the next election and then some. I just get different colors so I can have the benefits and still match my outfits <grin>!!

"The short story---I returned the watch 3 days after receiving it.
Now here's the long versino.
Originally, this watch had been on my Christmas list, and so it was with great anticipation when it finally showed up at my door on January 19th.
I opened the box, followed the directions and immediately signed up for the $59 MSN Direct Annual subscription (mistake #1). Within about 20 minutes, I had my MSN channels setup, and I was receiving signals and the watch was working fine. Setup was quick and easy.
I waited until the next morning, after letting the watch charge overnight, to try and get it on my wrist---much as I tried, the watch was just too clunky to fit suitably on my wrist. Now when I ordered it, I realized the watch wasn't going to be a fashionable one---but at this point, its clunkiness really bothered me and made me doubt my purchase. It was just either too loose or too tight.
Second problem. I follow a group of about 20 fairly large size companies on the NYSE and NASDAQ. Only 3 of them were available on the Stock channel of MSN Direct. And there seemed to be no rhyme or reason. 2 mid sized companies and one small company were all I could add to my Stock Watch list--leaving me 17 short.
Third problem. I realized I wasn't getting any Sports information displayed on the watch. Guess what? The Sports Channel is coming soon...
For nearly $200, plus a $59 annual subscription to MSN Direct, I expected to be able to get up to the minute Stock reports and Sports in addition to the News and Weather channels. Unfortunately, I couldn't, and so I returned the watch.
Amazon refunded my money yesterday (minus the shipping charges since the return was 'my fault').
I've been trying to get Microsoft to refund my $59 with less success. They claim they have issued me a credit card refund, but all I have on my credit card statement is a charge for the annual subscription and now a new monthly charge for the service. I'm about to make my 3rd phone call to them.
In summary, for me anyway, the watch didn't fit, and the MSN Direct Service didn't meet my expectations.","Sorry, not quite ready for prime time...",1.0,B000153MWW

The watch is a bit bulky, but given all the it does (time, stop watch, alarm, news, weather, calender and appointments) it is pretty amazing.  I have loaded the Outlook addin that allows appointment to sent from Outlook to the watch.  This is very, very cool.  I really love my smart watch.",Smart Watch!,5.0,B000153MWW
"I'm a techno-geek, and become interested in any new device that features a microprocessor of some sort.  After reading posts and reviews across the web about the Microsoft SPOT watches, I finally decided to take the plunge.  I am absolutely delighted with my purchase, and am finding it far more useful than just a simple geek-gadget.
I love the fact that my Outlook calendar syncs with the watch.  Sure, a PDA an serve the same puprose, but I hate carrying a PDA everyhwere I go.  Plus, the SPOT watch is automatically updated within minutes of making a change to my calendar.  No cradle or hotsync required...the watch udpates wirelessly while it's sitting on my wrist, anywhere I might be in the local area.  My wife can update my calendar to let me know she wants to have dinner tonight, and it would show up on my watch while I'm at work.  Personally, I think that's pretty amazing.  When an appointment time nears, it pops up on the watch along with a countown timer (in 15min, 14min, etc...).  Neat!
Stock updates are great also...a quick glance at my watch tells me how my stocks are doing today.  Again, all wirelessly no matter where I might be.  While the quotes are somehwat delayed (maybe 30min), still useful for keeping general track of how you might be doing for the day.
Everything was easy to set up, the watch really isn't much bigger than my Seiko (though I have big hands and wrists), and I don't find anything about the watch's materials to be cheap at all.  First time charging went smooth as silk, and set up took 5 min with content arriving on the watch within 30 min of activation.  Charging is cool to...you just set the watch on the included charging stand (I do it when I go to bed at night).  No wires to plug in or anything...the watch charges by induction.  A full charge is supposed to last 3-5 days, but I guess that would only come into play when going out of town.  Of course you must take the charger with you, so that's a bit of a hassle I suppose.
Overall this is a great watch and represents some cool new technology.  As far as service charge goes, I don't find $59 for 12 months to be unreasonable at all.  If you want to buy the watch and try it out, you can sign up for monthly service and get the first month free, then switch to yearly.  That way if you decide to return your watch, you won't be stuck with the service.",Not just a gadget...more useful than expected,4.0,B000153MWW
"Pros
-Use it like a pager
Only those who you let know your email can send you messages
For $59/year, not too high cost for the option. Users of MSN can send as many messages they want, with several lines of text.
-Better than a PDA if you're looking for just a calendar
Less clunky, easy to synch with Outlook. Great for someone who would rather carry around a watch, than a PDA.
-Great for News / Weather / Stock Hounds
Keeps you updated on the latest of all three, and does it very well. Even gives you tiny stock chart.
-EXTREMELY easy to set up.
Cons
-No ability to communicate with others
Calendar/Month view doesn't show notations or offer ability to move through month view.
-Large (not for women at all! unless you're big boned)
-Not as many channels as I would like to choose from
-Stopwatch/timer feature not as advanced as it could be
Overall, for the price, it's not bad, especially if you like to be an early adopter. And it shows lots of promise. Had no problem in an office building in Alaska receiving messages. Some people may end up getting 'early lemons', which I assume is the reason for the other bad reviews.
It's perfect for technology challenged types who would like to have a pager, cell phone and PDA, but really doesn't need all the overkill and hates being 'electronically chained' to a cell phone. PERFECT for delivery people!","It's new, so...",5.0,B000153MWW
"No, this won't replace your cell phone, and you can get more current info off the internet, but if you want to have sport scrores or stock quotes or brief news items available to you wherever you are, at the push of a few buttons, then this might be for you.
For me, the two most useful items are perfect time-keeping, linked to US national standard time, and MSN messaging.
I don't leave my cell phone on, and I don't give out the cell number, because I hate it when people think I'm at their beck and call.  But this gives me the ability to get some messages, at MY convenience, wherever I am.  A lot like email, but portable, and on MY terms.
I bought one at CES from the Fossil booth, and it took all of 20 minutes to register it, set up preferences and get my first message.
One small note:  the antenna in the Fossil watches is in the watchband, so you're stuck with the watchband they provide.  Suunto makes a SPOT watch with the antenna in the watch's rim, so you can change bands.  They lose a little reception strength due to the smaller antenna, but it's a trade off.
As far as the Fossil's reception -- I've had good reception in places (like buildings) where my cell phone doesn't see signal.  That's all I can ask.
The watch has a rechageable battery.  THe claim 2 days between recharges, but, even with my excessive new-toy usage, I still had 35% battery after 3 days, so a good 3 days is a better estimate.
Oh, the bulk of the watch isn't as bad as some say, although the fx-3000 model is bigger.  I have a Nike sports watch that is substantially larger.",Pretty amazing for what it is,4.0,B000153MWW

"This is a lovely and relatively inexpensive watch. Leather bands cause contact dermatitis on me, so I appreciate these bracelet-type watches with their flexible metal bands created by the individual links.

My wrist is larger, so I leave all the links intact and appreciate the result of the bracelet being long enough to provide some looseness. This watch is more silver than gold, and the gold is indeed pale. I like that effect very much, though, since I think the watch will probably work with any casual or business outfit and most of my other jewelry.

"I purchased this for my wife on January 31, 2014.  Loved the watch, keeps accurate time, nice feel to it, black face a refreshing change from the run of the mill braille watch.  Well, this satisfaction was not to last.  After just 11 months, the pins in the opening that insert into the holes in the case to keep it closed, they had etched a line into the case as it opens and closes, eventually eroding it to the point that it will not stay closed, kept popping open all the time.  We have a local watch shop that has a lot of experience with braille watches, we took it to them, they said they see this a LOT with Seiko Braille watches. It due to the fact that the case material (stainless steel I believe) is so much softer than the pin material (appears to be brass) that this issue is inevitable with all Seiko Braille watches.  They said to send it off to Seiko, they should fix that under warranty as its a design flaw.  RIIIGGGHT!

So off we send it to Seiko with a full explanation, they come back with a repair bill that is almost the price of a new one.  I argued my case, they seemed bored with me, like ""you want your watch back or not ?"", I got them to drop the labor charge which brought it just low enough to be feasible.  AND we had to pay shipping both directions.

NO MORE SEIKO PRODUCTS FOR US.

Now, compare this to two other customer service experiences we had within a month of this, Harmon audio systems and Diamondback exercise equipment.  Stellar service!  In the case of Harmon, we had a defective unit within warranty (just like the Seiko watch), they fell all over themselves to make it easy, sent me a UPS shipping label, and expedited the replacement, no hassles.  Similar with Diamondback.  Did I say

NO MORE SEIKO PRODUCTS FOR US.

Yes, I believe I did.

Before someone else points out that most Braille watches do this eventually... I know, we have had others do it too, but only after they were ragged and worn out anyway, and did not owe us anything.","Loved the watch, hate the customer service",3.0,B00021C41A
"I have owned two of these watches.  This was a couple of years ago, so perhaps they have improved since then.
The good.  I was very impressed with the style of this watch - very simple yet classy. I liked the soft, buckleless band.  I liked how easily the face opened.  The more rounded edges of the face look different from any other braille watch I have seen.  And, anyone who has owned more than one brand of braille watch will probably tell you that they are not all created equally.  I really liked how clear the dots are and the way they are spaced on this watch.
The not so good.  After about a year, the stem fell off of my first watch.  I wasn't pleased, but it kept running without the stem.  Then one day it stopped.  It wasn't the battery, and Seiko wouldnt cover the cost of repairs.  I thought maybe I had gotten a dud, so I bought another oneand these things are Not cheap!  Exact same thing happened with it!  Each watch lasted about two years.  Now I will say that I wear my watches all the time excluding the shower.  Someone said Seiko suggests removing the piece when washing dishes.  I never did that.  So, perhaps I was too rough on the watches.  Im just sharing my experiences.  Beware.  I can tell you that this is an attractive time piece, but I won't buy another one.
After the death of the second Seiko, I bought an Auguste Reymond watch, and although it doesnt come with the cool band, and the face is more standard, it has been a great and sturdy piece.

"I found this strap recommended in one of the customer reviews for the Casio MQ24 here at Amazon. I needed a replacement strap for the Casio MQ24. The watch costs around $10 brand new, so I was trying to decide whether to get another watch (since you get a watch, a battery inside and a strap installed) or just a replacement strap. I have two MQ24 watches and in about 2.5 years, both of their original straps broke off. I was wearing them sequentially, so the average is about 1.25 years per strap. Since the original straps did not prove durable, I decided to give the Voguestrap a try. If the original straps were more reliable, it probably would have made more sense to get another watch considering the prices. I have only used the Voguestrap for a couple of weeks, so it's too early to tell how durable it is.

It is about the same length as the original Casio MQ24 strap, maybe slightly thinner and slightly not as wide in some places. However, if you put one on top of the other, the holes align and you can see through them. The Voguestrap has a silver buckle instead of the black of the original Casio. The strap comes ""tame"" (for lack of a better word) out of the box. It fits just fine and it doesn't pop out.

The packaging includes two spring bars, taped inside with a small sign that says ""spring bars"". Don't recycle the packaging before you locate them. The original Casio MQ24 bars work just fine, but it's not a bad idea to keep them as spares.

Installation is simple if you are used it. I rarely change wrist straps on watches, so every time it is the same routine, I google for instructions and finally get it done after a few tries. It is simple really, you gently push inward and down. I don't have a dedicated tool, and I didn't have a really small screwdriver around at the time, but I was still able to get the old strap to pop out with a small standard screwdriver once I remembered to push inward and down at the same time.

One thing to consider if you are deciding to buy this versus buying a new watch. This is offered through the Amazon Add-On program. The oddity with this is that you can't buy it on its own, even if you are willing to pay for shipping. You must buy it as part of a qualifying Amazon order of $25 or more. This restriction also applies to Prime members. So it may still make more sense to get another watch instead of a replacement strap.",Works fine with Casio MQ24 watch,4.0,B00024WAK2

"I bought this same strap about 8 years ago to replace the regular watchband on my expedition.  I love this strap, since it keeps the watch close to my wrist and doesnt let it slide around, yet is hard to over-tighten like a regular strap.  Also, you can losen it it wear it further up your arm if elastic-cuffed sweatshirts bother you with a watch on (like they bother me).  The best thing I like about this type of strap is the elastic band that holds the watch. I work on vehicles quite often and I found this feature keeps the watch body from getting ripped from the strap (it will stretch or flip over before breaking the elastic or pins) when fitting your hand into tight spaces.  That's how my original band broke since there is no ""give"" built in.

After so many years this band has started to deteriorate, and I think I've used it well past several of its lifetimes.  The elastic is stapled and taped to keep it tight and the leather velcro cover piece is crazy glued on since the stiching has long since broken.  The webbing has held up exceptionally well, as has the velcro itself, which is why I haven't bought another one yet.  When one of those materials start to go, I'll break down and get another band.

"I had searched for the ""perfect"" automatic ladies watch.  I tried the seiko and it too was a good watch for about a year. At first, the only problem was losing a minute or so a day, but I had a Rolex from 10 years of work before I tried the seiko and it too lost about a minute or two every day.  Then after a year I found that it would stop for no reason. So my search continued until I landed on this watch, good looks, a quality name and a good review.  I was so ready to love it, until I discovered that in order to register it I would have to submit inaccurate purchase details, also the watch was gaining about a minute a day, but I can live with that.  I'd rather be early than late.  Also, I discovered that the description of the clasp was not correct, it doesn't have two release buttons on the side, but it does stay closed and releases without hassle.  I like it, but I don't love it.

It looks as elegant and clean as the picture and keeps great time. Many people can't wear quartz, and I'm one of them (ask your chiropractor for a muscle test to see if you are, too -- does your arm hurt?). Automatic watches are usually big and bulky, but this is the smallest and lightest-weight one I've ever had. It looks both casual and dressy at the same time. It's a comfort to know that if I get caught in a downpour, the watch won't be hurt.

* note - the pic with the unattached band - is my old band - with many HARD MILES on it.  It was always too small for me - but suprisingly, it still works GREAT!

This is the second one of these - i picked both up locally.

"Although Timex says this watch is water resistant to 30 meters, it has been my experience that the slightest exertion at the clinical lab where I work causes the crystal of this watch to steam up so badly that the time can not be read at all.  Simply the warmth of my wrist, not sweat from heavy exercise, renders this watch useless.  I have never encountered this before and am at a loss as to what to do because I have never gotten the watch wet or even damp. I could understand if there was even a small amount of perspiration involved, but there is not.  This is simply normal body heat under average work conditions where little exertion is required.  I am very disappointed and pretty lost as I expect any other watch of equal rating would have the same problem.  I haven't bought a work watch in 15 years or so and can't understand if this problem is new and the quality of Timex watches has deteriorated or what.  It seems that the quality is not what it once was.

UPDATE:  We returned this watch to Amazon and were stunned by how easy the process is to complete, costing us nothing and very little inconvenience, as well as how quickly we were refunded the purchase prices.

(where I live it's 10% and outright robbery!), excellent customer service, staggering selection, and ease of use.  Also, we repurchased the same Timex as there was a flaw in the first one.  It works perfectly, looks good for a work watch, and was incredibly inexpensive here on Amazon with Low Price, Free Shipping, NO TAXES!, and fast first-class service.

"I looked high and low for this style of watch because a family member had a similar one back in the 1940s when I was a child. I like the shape and the 30s retro appearence. I wanted a watch with a battery for the convenience and this watch fits the bill. I have had many compliments on the style. The one complaint I have is that the watch band is shorter than I would like. Increasing the length by a centimeter or two wouldn't cost too much for the maker and then I would have been 100% satisfied.

I probably will buy a few more, in case Timex quits making them.

There's another model, a half-step up from this one, that's got two separate clocks with alarms - v. useful in case you travel a lot, which I do.  Both of them have Indiglo backlighting.

"I took my Skagen to a mall watch shop to see how much it would cost to get the scratched crystal replaced. The guy said, ""$40 and it'll take two days"".  I get it, he needs to make a living but I got a crystal changed on a more expensive Skagen for $20 and it was done in forty minutes. He saw my expression of shock and asked, ""Is there a problem?"". I took my watch back and said that I could get 50 crystals for that much money and he quickly retorted in an arrogant tone, ""You can't change the crystal yourself"". A $1 GS crystal, a beginner set of watch tools, and twenty minutes say otherwise.  I guess I should thank the guy for being a jerk because his self-righteous attitude is what made me decide to change it myself.

I have just started to tinker with watches and it's an enjoyable hobby and if you need crystals definitely get them from GS. The quality is amazing and they treat the little common customer like me as if I was a professional ordering really expensive tools.

"A watch basically either works or it doesn't. A Seiko quartz watch is pretty much guaranteed to work, so whether the watch gets a good review or not pretty much depends on if you like the look of it or not, and only you can decide that! However, I'll review what I can of it!

The watch comes in a very nice blue Seiko box, with the watch strapped to a little pillow. Very nice presentation, it's ready to ""present"" to someone as a gift.

As with all watches, you will most likely have to go to a jeweller or watch store to have the bracelet adjusted to your wrist. Unless you have the tool to do it, you can't adjust it at home. This is pretty true with most watches, but when you buy a watch at a store, they will adjust the bracelet/band for you (free, probably). It's not expensive, like ten bucks or so, but just keep that in mind!

The watch itself is very nice looking (in my opinion!) and the bracelet and watch appear to be very well made. That is generally true of all Seiko watches. The bracelet is not just some shackled together cheapo thing, it's nicely made and sturdy.

The watch is a bit bigger than your typical dainty ladies watch, but I think it's a perfect watch for daily wear and is nice enough to wear ""out"", though since I'm a typical man, I have no idea about watch fashion. My wife says it's ""nice enough to wear out"" so I'm just passing that along. I mean, it IS called a SPORT WATCH, and not a DRESS WATCH, right?

You can't go wrong with it, and it's priced about right. It's not a cheapo, but it's not a diamond encrusted Bulova either.",Hard to review a watch .... but my wife loves it (or so she says!),5.0,B00068TIJ0

"I purchased this watch as a gift for my wife.  She absolutely loved it and wore it everywhere for a month or so.  After that month, one of the little hour markers inside, the one for 12:00, fell right off the watch face and started rolling around inside the watch, leaving no tick mark for 12.  There was no trauma to the watch, no impact or damage, it simply dislodged while on her wrist.

I had researched for a long time before buying a watch online.  This is usually something I would have gone to my local jeweler for.  My primary concerns was warranty issues with an online purchase.  I know Amazon's customer service is amazing, but their watches are supposed to deal with warranties through the company as I understood.  Well it turns out that some of my fears were justified.

Despite being a well known and worldwide company, Seiko's support was abysmal.  I spent weeks bouncing around between their company offices and devisions, waiting on callbacks, waiting on emails, being transferred from one number to another.  During one 2-week period every time I called I was told by a machine that I was calling outside normal business hours, even though I was not.  I know it wasn't a timezone issue because I both checked the timezone and because the message would tell me the current time.

The support eventually boiled down to this: There were 2 main devisions within the company, one who dealt with support for products during the 1st year, and 1 who dealt with products after that 1st year.  However, neither side would claim that this watch was their responsibility, and both were citing dual issues of me being in America rather than Europe and because I purchased online.  They wanted me to send in a signed card from the ""jeweler"" who had sold me the watch, authorizing where it was purchased, and a whole series of other things, the information from Amazon was not acceptable to them.

After about 3 months of getting the runaround I eventually just called amazon and related my experience.  The very next day there was a replacement watch waiting at home for me, and they simply asked that I send them back the old one with a label that they provided for me.  This new watch has been running fine for months now.

In the end, it's difficult to give a straight yes or no in terms of buying this particular watch.  It's a very nice looking product, my wife is very happy with it, but I hate to support a company that causes so much trouble for their customers.  I can't say enough about Amazon and their customer support, however, so whatever watch you end up getting I can say with confidence that buying through Amazon is a good decision.","Nice watch, Amazon great, Seiko very poor",3.0,B00068TIH2

"Very good looking watch. What I like most is it is sized for an 8 inch wrist.  One of my chief complaints with Amazon is they only show measurements in metric sizes.  I wish Amazon would also include U.S. standard measurements in inches, Or, at least provide a conversion chart next to each item for their customers.  Since I regularly mix white gold/silver pieces with 14kt. yellow gold, this watch suits me perfectly.  Easy to read and the clasp is easy and secures nicely.  It is a perfect sized watch.

"I've been looking at this watch for a while and finally decided to purchase it.  First of all, it's gorgeous.  Also, the hands and the number dots glow in the dark (I didn't know this until after I bought it--nice bonus!)  Also, the little manual it comes with it is hilarious (Do not store your watch in dangerous places for example between a sumo wrestler's 'cheeks'.  Do not lend your watch to a klepto.  Do not play fetch with your watch, etc.)  The wrist band was very stiff when I bought it but it loosened up after about a month.  Also, if you have a small wrist, this watch is for you.  This is the first watch I've ever bought that wasn't extremely loose for me even on the smallest setting (seems like they size even women's watches for men's wrists.)  This watch on the smallest setting fits me perfectly.

There are a few minuses, though.  This watch is not water resistant at all.  If it's anywhere near water or steam the face clouds up.  You have to take it off when taking a shower, and you can not leave it in the bathroom for any length of time, otherwise moisture gets into it.  Since my last watch was extremely water resistant, I find that to be a bit of a pain.  Also, I had a problem with one of pins coming undone and detaching the wristband from the face.  I bought a new pin for it though, and everything is fine again.

Though it has it's problems, I still would recommend this watch.  If you don't absolutely need the watch to be water resistant, you will be very pleased with it.",Beautiful watch--handle with care though.,4.0,B0006VX5UU
"Bought this for my self, but it was bought from me, so am buying another one. Te watch looked far more than the price, wen I saw it I was happy even though I have a bigger wrist.

"This is a terrific watch at an even greater special price...a Pulsar for $24.95?! Whoopee! The watch is very attractive and clean in its design. The fact that it's reversible makes it completely flexible in terms of pairing it with other jewelry.  It goes with anything. My husband removed a couple links, tricky but doable. The bracelet and the clasp both reverse.  Even so, the clasp is a little difficult to close, but I found that if I rested my arm on a flat surface while clasping the watch, it was easy to hook and close.

"I bought this watch for traveling.  Instead of taking two watches to match my silver and gold jewelry, this watch reverses to compliment whatever I am wearing.

I usually have to have help getting it off.  If you have any kind of mobility problems with your hands I would not recommend this watch.

First of all, the ""crystals"" are actually less than 1 millimeter.  Secondly, there are just 12 crystals (one at each hour).  I thought that there were larger crystals around the entire bezel... that's just metal that is shaped to look shiny.

A nit, which applies to other (all??) watch manufacturers, is that it does not include any instructions for removing links from the band.  I said it was easy because I had recently removed links from another watch.

"PROS: Looks good.  Labeled ""Italian Leather"", and appears to be genuine.  Padded.  Stitching seems good.

CONS: Color is more red/cordovan than the brown in picture. Comes with two retaining straps for the end of the band after buckling (pictured).  One of these retaining straps fell off an hour after I installed the band on the watch.","OK overall, but piece fell off soon after installed",3.0,B000788WAK

"I needed to replace a watch band on my Nautica watch and did not want to spend a fortune on a cheap watch.  This band was a great match to replace the one that had worn out.  The quality is fine and although it is a bit stiff, I found that it broke in nicely.

While it is not a high quality fine leather that is soft immediately it is a great replacement for an everyday type watch.

I would definitely buy it again.",Good quality affordable watchband,4.0,B00077CXCO

"The watch itself is sort of heavy and I have a small wrist. If I tighten the strap enough so that the watch doesn't slide around due to its weight, then I get all sweaty under the strap because of the material. If I make it loose enough so that my skin can ""breathe,"" the watch doesn't stay centered on my wrist. I like the watch.

"I have searched for a long time for a woman's watch that is beautiful, slim AND useful. Many other ladies watches seem to be just fashion accessories. I own a few that are cute but difficult to tell the time on because they don't even have hour markers on them. Men's watches are functional but huge.

I finally found the perfect watch in this one! With chrome markers, you can easily tell time with just a glance. It also features a handy second hand, and even a calendar date function. All this in a slim pretty package with an elegant dark blue face. Practical enough for work, and gorgeous enough for dressed-up dinners. This watch completely exceeded my expectations!",Finally!

This is a plain face watch that is greatly enhanced by the watchband. It is a very pretty piece of jewelry. It has a strong clasp and I have not had any problems with it catching on anything or popping open. I was surprised to learn after I got it that it is not waterproof. I tend to wear my watches 24/7 but I have to take this one off every time I get around water. That's my only complaint about this watch and why I rated it 4 stars.,Beautiful Watch,4.0,B00070OX06

"I'm a life-long Star Trek fan. I've watched every series, movie and even the short lived cartoon series so when I saw this watch I had to have it.

Those who have actually seen the original Star Trek series staring William Shatter as James T Kirk will immediately recognize that shade of yellow and that unique font. It's a great design for any fan of the original series.

The watch has a leather band and stainless steel back. It keeps time perfectly and so far the battery is working great.

My only complaint is that the Star Fleet emblem looks a bit fuzzy on my watch, I don't know if they all have this issue but you don't notice the problem unless you're looking very close so it's not a big deal.

This watch isn't an official Star Trek product by any stretch of the imagination, but I knew it wasn't when I bought it and I'm glad I bought it. Sometimes an unofficial product can add flavor to a collection; it adds a sort of variety that official products alone can't provide.

Considering the low, low price and the quality of the product I would recommend this watch to any Star Trek collector.

- Live long and prosper",A great watch for a great price,5.0,8087049098

"I was searching for a new watch and my sister said she has always had good luck with Skagen.  I found this watch and loved the design.  It is extremely elegant and thin and looks way more expensive than it was.  The only thing I don't love is the latch mechanism.  It is a bit of a hassle to put on and sometimes comes undone if I don't close it just right.  They really should change the latch mechanism.  Otherwise, it is gorgeous and comfortable.  Looks good on a small wrist/hand.",Beautiful watch,4.0,B0000C9ZC4
"This is my favorite watch. I've had it for two years with no problems and still love it. It has a low profile and, since the crystal doesn't stick up, I don't have scratches on it.

"My wife bought me a Swatch for X-Mas. She got it while on travel. It cost approximately $125 (""SILVER THAW"" model 5436228073).

Complaints:

1) Swatch store never informed her that the band could not be manually adjusted at home. This is because the links are not the ""user-friendly"" kind that just have clasps. Result: I had to spend $10 to get the thing adjusted at a jeweler (no local Swatch stores).

2) At the time of getting the number of links adjusted, I hand over this brand new watch and immediately the band pin falls out of the thing. A brand new watch that now needs jeweler's adjustment and have a pin fixed. Result: An additional $7 on top of the previous expenses.

3) After getting the band adjusted and a new band pin inserted I figured I'm home free, that I might actually try to enjoy the thing. Wrong. Within only a few hours of wearing it the band pin again falls out. Result: Another $10 to have the thing shipped back to Swatch for a refund.

Overall result: I'm in the hole $27 because of Swatch.

Overall opinion: I know what the ""S"" stands for in Swatch.

Overall advice: Better off with an Armitron watch instead of this wannabe Euro-garbage.

Recommended: No","The ""S"" in Swatch",1.0,B0002FCBYG
"I received this watch as a gift and I absolutely love it.  When you tap the face, the hour hands allign at 12 o'clock, and then rotate together clockwise until they stop on one of the six 'bunny sutra' positions.  After a few seconds, they return to telling the time.  Unlike most of the Swatch 'gent' watches, I can't hear its ticking (thank goodness).  The only little glitch is that the 'game' will sometimes start on its own if your wrist is jarred, but it's not annoying enough to make me stop wearing it.
