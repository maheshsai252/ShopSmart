I bought the watch with ball for a 7-year-old boy. He told me he had been wearing it every day. I think he likes it.,Timex Kid's Watch # T75201 - Rotating Disc,5.0,B00020J18A
"These are great! I bought the black one with the lightening bolts for my 6 yr old. I think he wore it for more than a year constantly except to take a bath and for swim class (including at night). The battery died after a little more than a year. Unfortunately, to replace the battery with a water tight seal cost $25. I told him we'd buy a new watch. He chose the spaceship one... then he didn't wear it for 6 months. The other one is still in his drawer. He just started wearing it again... he loves it! I WILL buy one for my second son... probably the green one with the frogs!",I love these watches!,5.0,B00020J18A
I bought two of these one for each of my boys for Christmas.  One of the two watches never did keep time properly.  I even changed the battery.  An expensive fix that did not work.,Never Kept Time,1.0,B00020J18A
When my almost 4yr old grandson got to the Christmas tree it was the 1st thing he saw. He wanted it on immediately and Mom has had a hard time getting it off since. Very durable!!,favorite thing under the Christmas Tree,5.0,B00020J18A
This is a great gift for the money.  The face is clear and the strap is great for any sport kid.  Love it and the price!,excellent choice for 3-5 yr. old,5.0,B00020J18A
"My son liked the design of this watch, but the strap broke and could not be fixed! A kid's watch is not that hard to make -- it needs to be: sturdy, easy-to-read, and accurate! C'mon Timex, we expect better from you.",Flat Strap Broke,1.0,B00020J18A
"There are a few problems with this watch. First of all it was D.O.A. (Dead on Arrival)! Rather frustrating for an excited boy. The other big issue is that it is not blue... it is purple. The product image is very deceptive. I read another review saying it wasn't a strong blue but ours isn't blue at all! They are definitely having some consistency issues at the plant.

Bottom line... I wouldn't recommend this watch to a friend.",Not happy at all.,1.0,B00020J18A
THis watch is a very good watch especially for those kids learning how to tell time. My five year old is enjoying it. The band is also adjustable and fits to the hand perfect.,GREAT PRODUCT....,4.0,B00020J18A
"I gifted it to my niece on her bday. She is a tom boy,she loved the colour and the balls on it. Moreover the size wasn't a problem coz of the stretch band.",Good gift,4.0,B00020J18A
Our toddler had seen us putting on our watches and kept asking for one.  We got a free one out of a happy meal and he loved having it on but it kept falling off so I did some searches on the internet for a elastic banded watch and found this one. It's really great it stays on and though he can't tell time with it yet he really likes that he can wear his watch like mom & dad.,2 year olds watch.,5.0,B00020J18A
IT IS A OK WATCH BUT THE BAND COULD BE MADE BETTER AND BE A STRONG BLU COLOR FOR A BOY.,OK,3.0,B00020J18A
"We've had these watches over a year but now we've lost one, and we're getting another.  These watches keep good time and are waterproof - they've even ended up in the washer a couple of times.

The color of the watch hands matches the numbers - the hour hand matches the color of the hour numbers, and the minute hand matches the color of the minute numbers.  It is easier for kids to match colors than to remember that the the shorter hand is the hour hand.  This watch shows the minutes from 0 to 59.  Note that some other teaching watches either do not show the minutes, or show the minutes decreasing past the half hour (e.g., instead of showing ""40"" at the 40 minute mark, they would show ""20"".)

The watch glows with a blue light when the knob is pressed and the battery lasts a bit over a year.  This watch has a tick-tock sound which to me is more interesting than a silent watch. The band is soft, stretchy, and comfortable and looks really good for a few months, then it gets picked up and looks fuzzy.  The only thing I don't like about this particular watch is the second hand.  The second hand has little sports balls at the end which are attractive, but they are large enough to obscure the other hands for several seconds while they tick on past.",Well thought out teaching watch,5.0,B00020J18A
"We have one of these Timex themed watches for each of our kids.  We love these watches because they are good-looking and fun to watch the picture go around the face of the watch.  But more importantly, as a parent, I really like these watches because the hour and minute hand are color coordinated with the numbers on the watch face, and the minute numbers are shown in counts of five.  It makes learning how to read an analog watch much easier and fun for kids.  It's proven to be durable and has a warranty in case your kid loses it (I know because it happened to one of our kids).  I would highly recommend this watch and not get any other for a kid.",Perfect watch for kids and Fun too!,5.0,B00020J18A

"These looked so good for a boy in the picture but actually it's extremely hard to read time when the second hand is actually those balls that keeps on jumping before your eyes. I got it for my son when he was learning to tell time he was excited with the way they looked but then it made him hate telling time because he never got it right because of the design. Also the strap isn't strong enough, it's elastic and when it snaps once it's impossible to get it to fit tightly again. BAD idea for kids under 10 years.",Can't read time.,1.0,B00020J18A

"We bought these for our boys (ages 5 and 7).  While I agree that the adjustable band is great and durable, the timepiece ran slow after only a couple of months.  Not only that, the indiglo feature stopped working too.  If your kids are learning to tell time, and don't care if they have the correct time, this is an okay watch.",Disappointing,2.0,B00020J18A
I bought this item and gave it as a gift to my nephew. My brother said there was a price printed on the box which was 10 USD. But Amazon sold it for more than 10 USD... I was somewhat embarrassed because I told my brother it was bought more than 10 USD when I gave it as a gift.,the price does not match the one listed on the box,1.0,B00020J18A
"The plus is that it is inexpensive, so you won't care what your child would do with it.  The negative is that it doesn't keep time very well.  I'll look at it, and it would be 5 to 10 minutes behind.  You could adjust it, and it will be behind, again.  Don't know what the problem is with this watch!",You get what you pay for.....,3.0,B00020J18A
"I sent this watch to my five-year old grandson as his birthday gift. He was very proud wearing it because the second hand had a soccer ball on it and the strap did not need adjusting. Besides, he started playing soccer at that time.",Timex Kid's Watch,5.0,B00020J18A
"I am an adult with a small wrist and I LOVE these watches!  I have been wearing different styles of them for 15+ years as yard/casual watches and they are great. They used to be carried at local discount stores, hard to find now...glad they are here on Amazon. They are comfortable to wear, reasonably durable for plastic/elastic construction, keep excellent time and have never had any problem with waterproofing.  In fact, I bought my first one specifically for a beach/swimming watch. When the battery goes I get a new battery if it is still in good shape, or get a new watch if it is beat looking. Rather scratch and beat up this in the yard than a good watch!

"We bought this as a gift for our son on a special occassion. One week later, in a shallow pool and after splashing around for only a few minutes, it stopped working.

"This is the second time we have purchased this watch since my daughter lost her first one about a year ago and had been  missing it.  She loves the geckos and finds the watch comfortable to wear and easy to take on and off.  She has a friend who  has a watch in the same line (different design on band and face) who has been wearing hers non-stop in the shower, pool, etc. and it is still working fine!

I am happy to learn, now, (wish I knew it before) that Timex has a kids loss protection plan which means the watch can be replaced for half-price for up to one year after purchase.",My 11 year-old daughter loves this watch!,5.0,B00021CLMM
"I'm an adult with small wrists, so I usually wear kid sized watches. I got this watch as a cheap, fun watch to wear in situation where I didn't want to risk ruining one of my good watches. I got a kick out of watching the little lizards going round in circles. (I'm pathetically easy to amuse.) The indiglo feature was very useful at night. The water resistancy seemed decent enough; the watch continued working after I wore it in the shower. The watch performed its duties adequately until the battery died. By that time the watch was so beat up I just threw it away instead of replacing the battery.
Things I didn't like about the watch:
-Crystal didn't hold up to being sprayed with bug repellant. It got cloudy.
-Elastic band gave up the ghost about the time the battery died. Perhaps it didn't like sunscreen and bug repellant either.
-Ticking second hand was rather loud. I used to wrap the watch in a shirt or a scarf when I took it off for the night.

All in all, it's an ok watch if you just want something functional and don't expect heirloom quality.",Cute functional cheap watch,3.0,B00021CLMM

"My 7 yr old liked it. However, the indigo light only worked for a few weeks. I changed the battery to see if that was the issue and it wasnt. The rubber gasket, which makes this waterproof, is slightly too large, and the channel its supposed to fit into is very shallow, so I wasn't able to get it placed well enough to make it seal properly. So, basically, no light, no waterproof, and also the buttons are hard to press.

This watch might be perfect for somebody else. We tend to love Timex - but this was WAY to small for my 11 yr old. Hes not skinny but he isn't overweight either.

The watch is great- perfect for my seven year old grandson. Wish I could say the same about the band.

"Ever notice how hard it is to find a watch that really fits the arm of your 6-year-old? Not any more. This not only gave my kids a watch that actually fits, it was fun for them to assemble them, and they are still mixing up the colors of the bands. You can simply add or subtract links to get the perfect fit. The different links provided means if it breaks, there's plenty of spares. There's no spare clasp pieces, so if they break the clasp, they're done, but the clasps are quite sturdy, the kids have broken a couple of links without breaking the clasps already. They have learned to be aware of the watch on their wrist, so they haven't broken any more links since the first few days (and there's twice as many links as what we need).

"These watches are awesome.  My two sons, ages 6 and 8 are crazy about them.  They get to customize it to their own likings which makes it easy to tell their watches apart.  When they get tired of it being the same way they just change the Lego pieces around (which helps them in patterning skills and math) and they have a different watch.  My 8 year old had no issue changing his around but the 6 year old might have touble with this since the peices are tiny and snap tightly in to place (that's what Mom's are for).  This is a great beginner's watch but also large enough for older users.  I wore it and thought it was great as well.  It was very fun to wear, everytime I looked down at it I smiled.

"I've been wearing a Lego watch since a friend found one for me in a retail store in Germany a couple of decades ago. If I'm out in public, particularly doing air travel, I always get comments, and people are often surprised that there is such a thing as a lego watch. It certainly catches people's attention (especially flight attendants). I tend to forget it's on, since it's so light weight. Except on extreme days, I don't find my wrist full of perspiration. The negative of just owning one of them is that for the adult wrist, one needs about 24 links, and if you want a balanced number of repeating colors, it's short a green link. I like the larger size face, but the second hand is more prone to fall off. And that's the only problem with the smaller model -- that if dropped repeatedly the second hand will fall off on this one too, and then it jams. But for the price, I just order another one.",Best Watchg Ever,5.0,B000KFB4PK

"Thought this would be great for our Lego obsessed kid, but in reality, the idea of this watch doesn't make sense. Legos are all about building, putting together, taking apart. If you make a Lego watch that looks enticing to build & take apart, you'll never have a wearable watch. Which is exactly what happened to us. After the first ""build"", many of the pieces have gone missing so now the watch is too short to wear AND we've lost one of the end pieces. So, pretty much useless now.

I have been wearing a Lego watch for over two years.  I am on my third one and they all have kept perfect time.

The only problem is that it appears very difficult, if not impossible, to replace the battery.  When I tried to take off what appears to be a removable cover, I broke a glue seal.  I could never get the replacement battery or the top to work again.  However, a new watch is not much more than a new battery.",I am on my third one and they all have kept perfect time.

The number of compliments I've received on this soccer watch, from other 19 year-old college students and adults alike, has been pretty incredible.

The fact of the matter is everyone loves Legos, and having a watch that can be disassembled, reassembled, resized, and customized any way you like makes it even better.

Get one. The only thing the watch does is tell time, but it's very durable and classy.

UPDATE: It didn't last as long as I'd hoped -- less than a year. Actually, it was only one piece that broke, but it was one of the halves of the clasp, and there weren't any replacement pieces in the box. Bummer!",This watch rocks for all ages!,5.0,B000PXUA5W

"A great time piece with a nice little flare. I'm 74 and have been wearing the soccer watch for many years (I'm on my fourth one). Light , accurate and a great conversation starter. The soccer watch is much brighter and easier to read than the other darker, busier faced Lego watches. I think Lego should remember that the first purpose of a watch is to tell time easily. The dark or busy images of most of the selections are almost unreadable. One example is the learn to tell time watch which at first I thought would be a great addition to my collection. It is so busy and similar colored that no youngster, much less an old man, could make sense of.  Use the soccer watch as your guide. It is simple, elegant and a great time piece.

He also really likes the velcro band. I found that rolling the leather tip of the watch band to match the curve of the wrist helps the end of the watch(which sticks out from the wrist on smallish wrists) to stick to the velcro near the watch case and thus from catching on things - looks better too.

We've had it 1 week and its already gone through the wash and came out working! (Momma here needs to learn to start checking pockets....).He's received a lot of compliments on it and he just beams whenever someone asks him what time it is.
Overall, great buy. I'm amazed it survived the washing machine honestly.",3 year old loves it - held up so far!,5.0,B000SZPZV6

"I just love these watches. We got two for our kids (6 and 8 years old) and they learned telling the time in no time at all. We particular choose the ""plain"" ones vs. the Star Wars ones since they are easier to read. The face is basically what the kids know from school.
We have those watches now for several months and so far no problem at all with the closures. They seem very sturdy. My oldest accidentally took his into the pool (until his screaming mom saved the day) and no problem at all.

"I purchased this watch as a Christmas gift for my 7-yr.-old son, who is VERY into Legos right now.  He mentioned that a friend at school had a Lego watch.  He has learned to tell time with no assistance, so I thought it was time he had a real watch with a face---he has had numerous ""cheap"" digital ones the last couple of years.  He absolutely loved the watch when he opened it. He wears it all the time, and he really liked the car that came with it.  The only reason I didn't give this watch 5 stars is that it seems a little lightweight and flimsy.  The first few times he wore it, he had trouble getting the  clasp to stay closed, and it fell off.  After he learned to snap it correctly, there haven't been any problems, and it keeps time just fine so far.  I'm just a little worried that it won't withstand the ""rough and tough"" life of a 7-year-old boy .  Otherwise, I think it's a great watch for Lego lovers.",For Lego Lovers,4.0,B0010OIN90

My son used his birthday and holiday gift certificates (thank you grandparents!) and he chose two Lego sets and this watch.  As much as he loves the Legos, he is absolutely thrilled with the watch and mini-figure Luke.  Even the little details are great (The Luke figure has a flesh hand and a gloved/mechanical hand for example).

We did have to help him a little with the set up--adjusting the pieces of the watch band and setting the initial time, which was no problem.  This is a GREAT item!

"I purchased this watch from Walmart for about 15 dollars after seeing it on this website. I bought it for myself, (Even though I am a 17 year old girl. I love Darth Maul and I needed a watch. How perfect.) I love putting it together and taking it apart. The plastic is really strong, but there is a downside to that; The pieces are kind of hard to take apart when it's just two pieces linked together - It takes some strength to pull them apart.

Other than that, Everything is perfect. Everything fits, everything works, infact, I am so impressed by how accurate the clock is. I set it to the correct time once, and the watch isn't fast or slow, it's perfect.

If you love Star Wars and need a watch, Don't be afraid to buy this. It's amazing quality and it's fun! Oh, and did I mention I got the cutest little Darth Maul figure with it?",Love this!,5.0,B00385WZC0
"I thought this would be a good gift for a little boy, but I was disappointed. The idea of assembling a LEGO watch is interesting. It involves children's participation, but the material is very cheap looking plastic, and seems easily breakable. And one of the parts, a ring for the watch face, doesn't fit in at all. Boys between 4 and 7 may be interested in this kind of stuff. According to the quality, I think it is worth at most $10, even though the list regular price is over $20. Don't let the price cheating you.","cheap stuff, not worth more than $10",2.0,B00385WZC0
"This watch was a birthday gift for my 6-year old boy.  He's had it for a little over one month now.  It comes with a Lego Mini-figure & he totally loves the watch & the figure.  It is very light-weight & the links come apart pretty easily (after you figure out they have to be in a certain position to release.)  In fact, they'll come apart sometimes when my son takes off the watch...which is the only downside.  The clasp is very easy to use.  Although, it is more of a 'hook,' but nevertheless, serves its purpose rather well.  The links come in 3 different colors & has 2 different snap-on 'face guards' so you can customize it anyway you'd like.  The watch face is a bit small but is still readable.  It also keeps time pretty accurately.  If your child doesn't like this character style watch, there are many others to choose from...and the price was 'just right.'  Overall, a good first watch for the price...especially with the Lego's brand name attached to it.",May This Watch Be With You,4.0,B00385WZC0

"I gave it to him for Christmas. He loves it. Every time I see him he's wearing his watch. He doesn't know how to tell time yet but I bet it won't be long. He does ""guess"" at the time. He will look at his watch and say ""Hey! It's 12 til 7!"" And then a little later, ""Hey, it's 10 after 2!"" He plays with the lego figure separately. I believe it ended up in his lego bin. But he likes to attach these little lego pieces to his watch as part of his play. On the band on either side of the watch face there is a lego piece as you can see in the picture. He ""customizes"" his watch with little legos on them. It was a great lego gift that was different from the rest he can wear all the time.",My 6 year old nephew loved it,5.0,B00385WZC0
My 7 year old grandson was thrilled with this watch. I was thrilled to give him something that he has enjoyed so much over the last few weeks.  It seems to be holding up well and he'll probably lose it before it stops working so I have no long range expectations!,Great present,5.0,B00385WZC0
"My children love Legos.  As in, they'll disappear for a few hours to build and then play with their creations in the Lego room.  So when my 5-year old was regularly telling time to the nearest 5-minute mark, we got him a Star Wars' themed Lego watch for Easter.  The links are very easy to add as the child grows, which is good with their still-rapid growth in early elementary years.  About a year later, the band's attachment to the watch face had worn enough that it was regularly disengaging; eventually, the watch fell off without my son noticing and was lost forever.  But he loved it so much and the timepiece is inexpensive enough, we decided to go ahead and replace it with yet another Star Wars' Lego timepiece, just with the Darth Maul character in place of the original Luke Skywalker.

If you want a watch that will last forever, you might consider something with a more traditional band.  But if you want something with engaging characters that children love to wear and use to practice their newfound time-telling skills, go with this piece.",Excellent choice for child's first time-piece,4.0,B00385WZC0

"The first time I saw a Lego watch was in the 1990s during a trip to Germany. I found the idea so cool that I had to have one and spent a lot of money.  I had it about 8 years under fairly regular use and it was running all that time.  By the time I lost it, Amazon had the Lego watches and I I got a new one for a fraction of the original price.  It too became my favorite watch; not only because it is always a conversation piece, but also because I found it easier to read than any of my fancier watches.  It died after 10 years of service and used about 4 batteries during that time.  They don't seem to make them in the exact same style anymore, so I bought one in the Darth Vader style, presuming that the innards are of the same good enough quality. The links of the arm band seem to be interchangeable between all models so I can now mix and match all different Lego colors.  Right now my arm band is black-red-yellow, the colors of my favorite team and winners of the soccer world championship in Brazil.",Not Just a Toy,5.0,B00385WZC0

"My boys really loved these when they opened them on Christmas morning.  We sized them (no trouble at all, easy).  But when it came time for each of them to put their watches on, they had an incredibly hard time managing by themselves.  One son is 9, the other is 6.  Once they were one (with help), the watches snapped themselves off pretty quickly.  The clasp piece isn't as secure as I would like, and it came undone when they hit their wrists while playing.  One even came undone as my son tried to put his arm into his coat sleeve.  I love them because they are so cool, but it's not something they can use every day.","Very cute, but hard for a child to put on and take off",3.0,B003GSP24W

"Buyer Beware! I bought this watch to replace the Timex my son loved and wore every single day until it broke and he is afraid to wear it because he thinks it will fall off and get lost. He loves Star Wars, as does any 8 yo boy, but his favorite part of this watch was the little Yoda action figure that came with it. As for the quality of the watch, the case is cheap plastic and while it says water resistant to 133 feet, I would be afraid to let him wash his hands! If I can find all the parts, I will return this watch and buy him a Yoda action figure... or ten. Don't waste your money!",Caveat Emptor!,1.0,B003M2G0SY
"I bought this and another character for my 8 year old son and another 8 year old boy. The watch is very nice, great concept. He is still grasping the concept of time so I love that it has the minute markers on it and the numbers are visible.

My son is a little rough and for some reason, every day he'd come home with half of the links in his hand. It got to the point where they didn't really stay on well. I blame this on my son more than anything.

So I wouldn't say this is a bad or poorly constructed watch as other reviewers have said, but I will say that you should know who you're buying it for. If you have one of those curious kids who take things apart, or one who is just rough and careless, then maybe it's not a good everyday watch for them. He still uses the face to tell the time, just lost all of the pieces becuase he's careless.

It's a nice watch.",Not that bad,4.0,B003M2G0SY

"I was very excited about getting this watch for my 6 yr old but was very dissapointed when I received it. The watch itself is cute and I love that the hour and minute hands are labeled. It also comes with a small paper practice clock. However, the thing that so sorely dissapoints me is the band. It is a strong Velcro band but very poorly designed. It really only sits or secures well at one size. And what's the point of an adjustable band that doesn't actually adjust? Not every child has the same size wrist. Technically I think you could adjust it but the band is so thick it is hard to get it to bend and I'm not sure it would ever flatten down. Plus, when you make the band bigger it leaves the scratchy part of the Velcro exposed. That would be irritating and annoying within minutes.

The adjustable leather band is great too. I had previously purchased another Disney watch with a Velcro band that was terrible and I am sending it back.

I buy children's watches for two reasons:  I have a very small wrist, and I teach young children.  I use my own watch when I'm teahing them to tell time

Timex was always my go-to watch.  The timex children's watches fit my wrist, and they are sturdy and dependable.  They used to have some excellent watches to help children learn how to tell time.  Those don't seem to be available any more.  The entire Timex line is superior to this Red Balloon watch.

So now he can't change the heads anymore because of the broken prong that is stuck in the watch. Also the head that has the broken prong on it, doesn't stay on any longer either since it just has one prong. One other problem with the watch is that it comes apart way too easily at the links of the watch. He almost lost it the second day he wore it because it came apart at one of the links near the face of the watch. Luckily we found it in my vehicle after he realized it wasn't on his wrist anymore.

"My 8 year old son got this for Christmas - it's a really cute watch! The lights are multi-colored and very bright, it's going to be great for nighttime viewing someday, though almost too bright. Very entertaining though!

The band is a soft flexible rubbery material, seems very comfy to wear. He wore it all day today and even wanted to sleep with it on! very cute for a young child!

I have to agree with other reviews, there are no minute increments on the watch, and the Superman symbol is slightly larger on the actual item. So it's not totally as pictured. But overall, very cute watch!

Watch out for the rubbery ring that you tuck the band in though -- if it slips off, the watch is useless! This should not be so easy to slip off! But it is :(","Very cute watch, Lights Very Bright!",5.0,B009SZSDEI

"I was very impressed with the quality of this watch for $13 here on Amazon.  I am a Sr. citizen who has always owned a Mickey Mouse watch and recently lost the last one, and my 3 year old grand daughter is in love with the MM crew and Minnie's Boutique. So my loss and her birthday sent me on a search and I bought one for each of us.  I obviously did not want a pricey watch for a 3 year old and she gets aggravated with it on her wrist after a while, but that would be the case for any snug watch. When she does wear it, she loves it and that MiMi and she have matching Mickey watches. Most adults could not wear this watch with the attached vinyl watch band. I have very small wrists and there are 2 holes left to increase the size.  The watch bezel and face are amazingly very good quality, it keeps great time so far, about 3 months of daily wear for me.

The stem is protected by metal side guards that keep it from accidentally pulling out, a feature that adds to a watch I feel is well designed to withstand daily childhood trauma. On the other hand, this is a 'teaching' watch per Amazon description and a young child would have a very difficult time pulling out the stem to change the time. Small fingers are definitely as asset.  The case is stainless and holding up wonderfully. I like the white band because it goes with everything. I'd buy this watch again in a heartbeat.",Sturdy watch for the price!,5.0,B00AQCW4RY

"This was purchased for an 8 year old, and our views are a little different.

Based on his response and use, this would be a five star watch.  He wears the watch all the time and is consistently referencing the time.  He likes to use it as an alarm clock so he can get up for school and the stopwatch to see how long it takes to do various things.  While he has only had it for a few weeks, he has been more than satisfied - that the date appears on the watch makes him even happier.

Based on what I've seen, I'd give the watch something closer to three stars.  The light is your old standard yellow that will fade soon enough instead of the indiglo-style blue light that has been around long enough to not be an expensive option.  The three dials are somewhat meaningless, with the third used for a timer that you've got to read the manual to understand (that should say, the not-kid-friendly manual).  The watch enters set up mode by selecting quickly through clock -> alarm -> stopwatch -> clock set.  Again, this is a not as friendly to kids solution that makes it easier to change the time than needs to be.

I've always been pleased with Casio for producing cheap, accurate, no frills watches, but this one feels like one of those ""look like an adult watch"" frustrations and I think we would have been more satisfied with the more basic Casio.","I think it's not so great, but it's a kids watch and the kid likes it",4.0,B00ATXGZMK

"This is the second watch just like this that I've purchased for my 11 year old daughter - and the last. Despite being water-resistant to 30 meters, both of them were damaged by incidental water exposure. The first one she got wet in the shower - noticed it and immediately took it off and I dried it with a towel within a minute of the exposure. It fogged up and then the face had missing parts of the display. Since it fit her small wrist where others don't, I ordered another one. This one she got wet by jumping in the shallow-end of the pool with it - noticed it and took it off right away and dried it. Same exact problem. I don't call this water-resistant.

Best of all, they really like the timed alarm feature to help them manage when to take periodic breaks from doing their homework or chores or playtime. The younger one needs a little help with buckling the watch, but if any other prospective purchaser is hesitant about sizing for a child's wrist, don't be.

"Bought this for my grandson. He wanted a watch so bad and he loves Lego's. I got him the Cole watch and Lasha 2 Pack set for Christmas. Great bargain...I thought.

The Cole watch turned out to be difficult to read-- due to the dark, cluttered, background image on the watch face and also because the hands are thin. But worst of all is the band. It's made of Lego pieces, snapped together. It was difficult (at first) to unsnap and re-size (by taking out or adding links). Once sized, my grandson wore it once or twice, then decided ""Hey, it's a Lego, so I'm gonna take it apart"" (he's 5). Well, he disassembled the watchband and then he tried to reassemble it but couldn't because he lost the part that snaps the band together, the ""clasp.""

"Here is my take on this. It isn't too expensive so it isn't going to be super awesome. However, I DID expect it to work. It came to me with no display. I assumed I needed to turn it on somehow. Nope. Batteries included? Yep. Not working. I tried to call the number on the package. Disconnected. Website? Dead. Ok so the reason amazon only has 3 left in stock is because these are probably old ass watches and the company went out of business. I'll return the watch. I am bummed because I really wanted it to work. If they can replace it with one that actually works right I'll be happier. I DO however think it's lame that I have to pay to send it back. Not my fault that it's broken. I can't speak to the quality of the product because I don't know. Right now I just have a pink bracelet. It is a little heavy, but not too big like the Brickhouse watch. I bought the AmberAlert GPS 3G as well. I liked this because it was always with my kid, she couldn't just drop it by accident. If you want to try it, know that if you open it, you can't get a refund unless it's broken. You also have to pay a restocking fee of 15%. And the company is most likely gone. I would keep looking. Check out the Amberalert 3g gps system. It's much more money but if you are looking for something serious it is where it is at.",Meh,3.0,B000AEZS26

However, the kids would have to press 2 buttons on either side of the watch when they realize that they are missing.  This is not easy for kids that age to accomplish, plus, it is basically useless if someone grabs them.  This might be a great tool for older children if they get lost somewhere, but it is not effective at all for young children.

"I looked everywhere for the TOMMY Burger King Watch; they are very hard to find. I finally found one and it's just like the one I had as a kid.

Watch is GREAT and takes you back to the GOOD OLE DAYS :)",I finally found one and it's just like the one I had as a kid,5.0,B001J7MEBG
"I bought this expecting to get the blue electronic Tommy watch they had sold at Burger King when the first movie came out, the very same watch I had adored as a young boy. I literally counted the days for my watch to arrive so I could hear that lovable baby say ""A baby's got to do, what a baby's got to do."". When I opened the package and saw none other than Chuckys nerdy face instead of Tommy's bald-headed charm, I went ballistic. Nonetheless, I am extremely complacent and am wearing it right now.

Other than being completely disappointed, it is a pretty standard watch. The batteries were dead upon arrival which makes it unusable, but those can be replaced. The scratch and sniff banana print on the watch smells like a combination of plastic and bananas, a bit pleasant if you like odd smells. If you're a fan of Chucky from the series, get it. If you're a casual shopper looking for some items that cause massive amounts of Tommy related nostalgia, be prepared to be disapointed.","""Tommy""",2.0,B001J7MEBG

The ringbearer was gleeful to receive this watch. I originally ordered it from Amazon and they sourced it to Target. I ordered it on July 10 and as we approached July 31 I revisited Amazon to see that Round Rock Distributing had the item available and could ship immedeately. It arrived on July 31 after ordering the week before. It is now Aug 11 and still nothing from Target. Target does not recognize the lego number. Round Rock did great and the ring bearer spent the wedding and reception twisting and adjusting the watch. Great gift for a 1st grader. So far no complaints a week later. Great way to show children how to tell time. I did it with my own children many years ago.--------It is now August 18th and Amazon is still blocking me from cancelling this order from Target. Target knows nothing about this item. Past product? There is no way to email amazon to ask them to cancel the order or rail at them for their obstinance. The latest estimate is Aug 27-31. I can't cancel the order on the 18th because it it in process as it has been since early July. We need a way to contact Amazon!,wedding gift for grandson,5.0,B000XQ91Y2

"My daughter really likes the slap-watch style and has gone through a few of them.  The first suffered a split of the rubberized cover exposing the spring metal underneath.  That took over a year to become an issue so I write it off to normal wear and tear.  The second slap watch was made with somewhat floppier rubber resulting in the watch actually popping out of the case because the flex induced by the curling of the strap around a small wrist turned the circular rubber retainer section into an oval with a big enough gap to allow the watch to fall out.  This issue was clearly the result of mediocre materials for the purpose.  The Euro Sparkle watch associated with this review is the third we have purchased and is a good unit.  It is made of a stiffer rubber and is holding up well.  Note that the watch ships from overseas so it took a while, maybe 2 weeks, to arrive here in Maryland.",Good watch for kids.

"I've been wearing this watch for about a month and a half now, and it's great. It keeps time like a champ, and if anything might run a minute or two fast. The days of the week can be set to English, or French; the work days are written in black, Saturday is written in blue, and Sunday is written in red. The face is a deep sapphire blue with luminescent dots near the stick markers, and luminescent bars on the hands. It only takes a little time in bright sunlight in order for the marks to glow bright. The only issue that I had was getting it sized initially- the pins in the metal band are apparently quite tight/small, so I had to go to a watch specialist (rather than just a jewelery store) to get the band fitted.

So nearly one year on, this watch is losing about 15 minutes every week.  This isn't horrible and with some thought one just has to remember to check the time to make sure its right every so often, however, it could make someone late and speaks somewhat to the quality of the watch.

"UPDATE, 2 months later, the watch stopped running except its second hand would flail around a bit. Thinking it had a prematurely dead battery, I took it to a trusted watch shop who told me the movement had died. Junk, and not a cheap watch. Next time, I'm going digital.

This is a well-made watch. I bought it for my 5-year-old and he learned to tell time with the help of this watch and his teach me time alarm clock. A leather band and buckle can be a little fiddly for little hands, although he has mastered it, one month later. My one regret is that little fingers can't stop playing with the rotating bezel, which is the silliest idea ever. For a kid just learning to tell time, what is the point of a rotating chronometer-style bezel? The problem is, your kid will inevitably turn the bezel so it no longer has the ""60"" up (and it should say ""00"" if you ask me) and then they can't use the bezel to figure out how many minutes past the hour it is. I eventually trained my kid to make sure the ""60"" is up but it's a silly nuisance for a useless feature. The watch is at least mildly water resistant--we have not put it in the tub or anything like that, particularly because the band would likely not handle it well in the long term. Overall, given the limited choices for learning watches, this one was a solid pick, but not perfect.",A solid choice for a first watch,1.0,B005OVFDDY

"I owned a slightly different version of this watch about 10 years ago and absolutely loved it. The leather band and metal housing really helped to give the watch a premium feel, unlike most kids watches which feel like cheap plastic toys. As an 8 year old I felt pretty darn mature purchasing this watch in the Disney Store with my Buzz Lightyear wallet and wearing it to elementary school.

I wore the watch for many years without it failing. The battery only died after I had outgrown the watch and left it sitting for some time. I now wish that I had kept it as it really was a nice watch that I could have passed on for someone else to enjoy by simply replacing the battery.

"The case diameter is 30mm, but the face diameter is 24mm, which makes it hard to tell time.  It also has a blue second hand and a blue band at the edge of the bezel -- not helping much.  The numbers are small, the ""hour"" and ""minute"" labels on the hands are even smaller, and the minute counting numbers (5,10, 15, 20...) are miniscule.  The band utterly, completely sucks.  The nylon band does not have loops, it's threaded through the pins and behind the case.  The strap has 2 parts: the outer part is blue and has the velcro fold-back closure.  The inner part is sewn to the band at one end and the other end is velcro-ed to the blue band--it covers the pins.  Unfortunately, it also makes the band too stiff.  It also makes the minimum size too large for a small child.  A simple nylon band with loops would have worked much better.","Small face, hands lack contrast, very cheap band",2.0,B005OVIX4A

"We bought this for our first grader for Christmas (he is able to tell time on an analog watch/clock). I had read that the watch band wasn't very good, and we quickly found that to be the case. The band fit him, but the velcro was separating from the rest of the band. Finding information on the proper width for a new watch band led to my having to purchase not one, but two, replacement bands, which of course were both long because finding a replacement band for a kids' watch at a reasonable price is surprisingly difficult. The one we ended up using cost us about $12.

After about a month of our son's wearing the watch daily, the second hand fell off and just rattled around in the watch face. No big deal to us, but it saddened him so much that he stopped wearing it. About a month later, he decided he wanted to wear it again despite the broken second hand, we reset the time (the pin had been pulled), and he wore it. After school that day, he showed me that the watch crystal had a crack in it, and he didn't know how it happened. (I'm fully aware that he's a first grader and that kids are rough on things, so it may totally be his fault, but for all I know it may not have taken much to crack it. Just making readers aware.) I also happened to notice that the watch was showing a time an hour behind. I had him take off the watch and give it to me. I reset it and moved on. A few minutes later, I checked it again, and the time hadn't changed. The pin had not been pulled; the watch simply wasn't running any more. It's not worth the money to take it to a jeweler to replace the battery (if that's even the issue) on a watch with a cracked face.

"My son is 4 and loves this watch. The velcro closure is easy for him to work by himself. The only issue I have is what another reviewer mentioned: the outer ring rotates. I have never figured out why some adult watches have that feature, and I certainly don't understand why a kid's watch should have it. My kid turns it because he's a boy and it moves, so he has to mess with it. Other than that, it's a hit.",Almost perfect,4.0,B005PKZGRC
"The outer ring that helps kids tell minutes rotates and I'm trying to figure out why this would be.  Often, I'll look at my 6yr old's wrist and see that the 60 minute mark has rotated 90 degrees, which, you know, isn't helpful when you're trying to teach your kid time.  Also, the face gets scratched and cloudy very easily.  Like super easy.  Within a week it had so many scratches it was hard to make out Mickey's face.  Now, I understand it's on a  child who is probably pretty rough on it... but we bought a second on and watched carefully.  Just regular wear.  And still, it scratched and clouded up.  Not very durable, I'm afraid.  I love the idea.  The execution is lacking.","It's a nice idea, but has quality and design issues.",2.0,B005PKZGRC

I was a bit miffed, but Brian, the seller made SURE I got the blue one and on time for the party.  Brian was so generous as to have it gift wrapped too AND provided an additional strap for no charge.  He even emailed me the tracking details so I knew I would have it on time.

"If you want a cheap costume piece, this would be it. For a serious everyday watch,... NO! It is a wind up watch, so you must wind it every day. No big deal. But it is mostly plastic (antique brass ""look""). Especially the watch face cover.. not just plastic, but thin cheap plastic that seems like it's gonna fall off any second.

The return label on the box indicated it was from the Amazon Return Center which I thought was quite odd.  There were no instructions or warranty with the digital watch and clock.  I notified Amazon the instructions were missing and was told to contact the vendor (in this case Disney).  Amazon stated: ""I do understand your concern. In my experience, the quickest way to have this issue resolved is to contact the manufacturer directly for getting instructions on how to set the digital time. Here's their contact information: [...]
Contacted Disney Store and received the following: ""I certainly appreciate you taking the time to inform us of the difficulties you experienced when ordering.

"The Disney ""Cars"" Time Teacher watch does a good job of making it easy for kids to begin to understand how to tell time with an analog face.  There are dual bands around the face - one with the hours and another with the minutes in increments of five.  Also, each of the hands is labeled ""hour"" or ""minute"", so kids will instantly tell which is which.  I wish that the minute hand was yellow so that you could simply say that the red hour corresponds to the red hour band and vice versa.

The watch has kept good time for about a month now, although it's easy for a kid to pull the winder out and accidentally (or not) change the time.  The Lightning McQueen color scheme and graphics make it something that any ""Cars"" fan will want to wear every day.",A Great Kids' Watch and Teaching Tool,5.0,B008QVT2PE
"My son was very happy with this gift.  We have a rule that you must learn to read an analog watch before you can have a digital.  Anyway, he likes it and seems to understand the concept of the hour and minute hands.  My only complaint is that the minute hand covers up the minute numbers. Additionally the minute hand is in white but the hour numbers are in white while the minutes are in red.  This has been confusing for him- understandably.  If the hands and numbers were color coded, that would help lessen the confusion.

"This is NOT a kids watch. The title is a mistake, the people who are stating it's for kids are wrong, go to casio website for details. Besides that it's great and perfect size for no frills average adult digital watch.",Not a kids watch,3.0,B0099QJ52U
"This is not a kid's watch.  Whoever put that description in for this item deserves to be fired.  It has a full sized adult strap, and has a nice, large body with a very large and clear screen.  I bought it to alternate with my DW5600E G Shock, on the theory that the straps for both watches would last longer than if I only wore one watch all the time.  The differences with the DW5600E are that it has a larger, clearer screen with fewer details, and has a higher contrast ratio so it is easier to read for older eyes like mine.  It also has 50m water resistance instead of 200m, and probably won't withstand the kind of rough treatment that a DW5600E would shrug off nonchalantly.  It is a fair bit lighter and thinner on the wrist, so it won't worry shirt sleeves.  The light button is in the same place.  I'll have to wait and see if it recognizes this leap year, as there is no input setting for the year.  It is only half the cost of my G Shock, but provides 90% of the information.  I just played the alarm and it sounds almost loud enough.  The hourly chime is useful.  I think my money was well spent in buying this versatile, comfortable and useful watch.

"This is a great little watch for helping to teach young kids how to tell time. A few points about the watch:

1. Be ready to spend just a little time with the intended little recipient on how this is going to help them learn. There are some cardboard instructions included, but you're going to have to talk through what everything means on the watch, and probably reinforce the lessons along the way. The text is small, but young eyes should have no problem with it.
2. This is not the classic Disney watch with Mickey's arms pointing at the hours and seconds.
3. The band is a nice soft nylon material that is easy on kids' wrists.
4. A stainless steel case is included for the watch, which keeps it from getting damaged when not in use. It comes in handy.
5. It is water-resistant, not water-proof. This protects against dropping it into the water and immediately fishing it out, but I wouldn't go swimming with it.
6. The main feature of this watch that helps kids learn how to tell time is that the hour/minute hands are labeled, and the minutes/seconds markings have numbers every five places. My only suggestion would have been to color coordinate the hour hand with the hour markings, and the minute/second hands with the minutes/seconds markings. As it is, I think it's a great tool, but this would help have helped kids make the proper associations.","Helps kids learn how to tell time, with a character they know",4.0,B009CMHJVK

I was concerned that we were just going to be left with a broken watch, but after contacting the company, I was relieved that they were able to make things right again.  They are replacing it at cost, which is fine with me.  It wasn't their fault that it broke, but it wasn't my kid's fault either.  It was just a weird fluke.  I am just happy they didn't leave me hanging out to dry on it.  They have been very prompt and courteous and I am confident that the replacement watch will work out fine.

Size: Good with plenty of holes. However, he is very skinny, we added our own hole and you can't even tell. He'll be able to wear it for a few years unless he gets bored with it or outgrows dinosaurs.",It's good for practice - he seems like he has committed ...,4.0,B00BXKZDJ4

"WATCH- The watch is adorable and my seven year old loves it! He picked it out with his birthday money a few weeks ago and it's been a great buy for us. There was a slip of instructions on the back of the warranty in the case. I agree with another reviewer that a booklet would have been more helpful, but it wasn't too hard to figure out for my 7 year old. The watch looks nice and I would say alone is worth the under $12 we paid for the set.

TIN CASE- From the reviews I wasn't expecting much out of the tin case- basically just a display and storage case. I could tell from the picture that this was a tin case immediately from seeing the silver reflecting inside and was actually surprised by everyone thinking this was a real backpack when I read the reviews. However, the watch in the picture is much bigger compared to the tin case then in real life. I was expecting the picture was more true to size comparison and a tin case not much bigger then the watch itself after reading the reviews. The tin case is actually about the size of a tin lunch box. The plastic window is pretty thin, which is probably why it's not advertised as a lunch box. However, I think with a little careful packing or wrapping cold items in their own insulated bag, this would work very well as a themed lunch box (at least as well as a brown paper bag, but reusable, lol). Which is how we will be using it. I am honestly pleasantly surprised by the case that comes with this.

PLSUH TOPPER- The little plush topper is also bigger then I expected when reading pencil topper. I think the size would actually get in the way if on a pencil, but it is an adorable finger puppet. I would say it's about the size of a younger child's fist.",Great Set!,5.0,B00D3TSDQ8

When I received it, the flashed worked and all buttons were there but the time display didn't work. I tried doing every combination of the different buttons that I could think of and the different combinations that were on the instructions but it still wouldn't work.

"We were looking for a green watch for our 4 year old son for Christmas and couldn't find one at a store.  We were super excited when we found this one for a great price.  However, when we received it the size is much bigger than a ""kids"" size watch.  Other than it being larger than anticipated for a ""kids"" watch it's exactly as it appears.","Great watch, but a little big for a ""kids"" watch",4.0,B00DVTE6CA

"For the price, this is a superb pocket watch. It keeps time well, it has an awesome theme, it's very attention grabbing, & stunningly beautiful.  The only remotely negative about this watch in my opinion is the flawed number four....a Roman Numeral four is (IV) not (IIII)

"When I opened the mailbox to find the package containing this pocket watch I was thrilled to see that not only was it a different color than the pictured item I paid for, it also came pre-cracked. Fantastic! That way I don't have to go about cracking the glass myself, they went ahead and took the liberty of breaking my item for me! All sarcasm aside, really. Are you kidding me? Ive been bragging about this thing to my friends since I put it in my damn cart and now when they ask to see it I'm going to have to explain that it came broken right out of the box. Will not be buying from the seller again.",...,1.0,B00E3R7KJK
"When I first got this, I was astounded by how quickly it came. But then I took a look at the cover and saw that it was basically fan-art. Also, the pocket watch itself was rather poorly made. The back came off almost immediately after I touched it, and the chain is very fragile. However, design-wise, it was appealing. I liked the engravings on the metal. But, honestly, it was a poor buy.",There were more bad qualities than good.,2.0,B00E3R7KJK

"I went back and forth about whether to rate this a 2 or a 3, but decided to err on the side of generosity. There's really only one reason you would buy this item: you are a fan of Attack on Titan and you love pocket watches. Truthfully though it's not really that good of a watch. It's a pain to set. You kind of have to force the setting mechanism to close which I was afraid to do at first because the watch feels so flimsy and setting the right time is almost impossible (be happy to get within five minutes of the actual time).The only real thing that makes this Attack on Titan merchandise is the Scouting Legion insignia and that's on plenty of other better made Attack on Titan merchandise. The only positive point I can think of is that the watch is very silent.",Not the best,3.0,B00E3R7KJK

"So the watch itself was good and it works nicely but the only complaint I have is the image of the shield in the middle was a bit low quality. Though, I have to say, I DID only pay $10 for the thing so I can't complain much.

"With the normal 1 to 12 numbering on the dial, and the numbering by the fives (05 to 60) on the outside, this is a great watch for teaching a child to tell time. The only two drawbacks are 1) the hour hand is white, which is sometimes hard to see against the white background, and 2) the two little strips for tucking the end of the band in after fastening it fell off within the first few days of use so the band is always sticking out. My son is still very young (3) with a thin arm, so the watch is too loose for his wrist. Our solution: he wears the watch on his upper arm, over his shirt sleeve. He loves it, and it's easy for him to see and practice reading numbers and time.",Great for teaching a child to tell time,4.0,B005OVITUI
"I bought this as a gift for my 8 year old daughter. The watch looks exactly as what's pictured but does not even come close to fit a child's wrist. I sized this watch against a man's watch and this this one is a half inch shorter. There is no way this was meant for kids as the description states. Also, this watch does not come in a box like most others do but was in a cellophane wrapper like the cheap watches you would find at a flea market. Pretty useless if you intended to gift wrap it.",Too big for a child,2.0,B00DVTCYBA

"The wearer of this watch will immediately feel faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, and able to leap tall buildings in a single bound.

This watch is also amazingly indestructible.

It will survive interplanetary travel between Krypton and Earth.

And it's even freeze-resistant so if the wearer decides to clean the watch by blowing cold air towards it, the watch can withstand that force and temperature.

For those of you who are fashion conscious, the watch looks particularly great if you wear blue tights with some red and yellow accents.

Bottom line: If you're feeling a little down or your kid is feeling down, this watch is perfect to make you feel super again.",This Watch's Powers Are Unrivaled,5.0,B002LAR1LS
