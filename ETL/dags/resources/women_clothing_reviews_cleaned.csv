"I wear tights to work on meeting days and love the Semi Sheer Opaque in Black so you still see your skin underneath but they're dark enough to match my boots and outfits. These are reinforced so they control your stomach and keep everything perfectly hidden. They come in 3 colors, black, cappuccino and natural if you want them to look like your natural skin. They are very soft, easy to put on and comfortable. These are very true to size and fit as expected.  I purchased this product at a discount for my unbiased review. These add a professional element to my work clothes.",Look and Feel Great,5.0,5120053475
"Color: DAY 20 Naturale TG2

Size: Small

These pantyhose by Veneziana comes in 3 different colors to choose from: Black, Natural and Cappucinno.  I have the Natural one and it is really more of a Nude Color.  The material feels silky and luxurious.

The waistband is soft and comfortable and offer adequate control.  They are sheer and opaque pantyhose that does not feel thin and easy to rip.  I appreciate that it is a product import from Italy and the size is true to one I typically purchase in the USA.

In conclusion, I rate this Women Pantyhose by Veneziana 5 out of 5 Stars. It is a comfortable and a quality product I recommend.

"I received these tights in the natural color; and it is exactly that - a natural look, without being too dark or light. The waist band is tight enough to stay up, without causing unwanted lumps.

"The fit on this is awesome, and I love the design. However, a few things prevent me from rating it higher than three stars. First, even with the adjustable straps (which are nice), the chest area is way too low. I'm nursing (one main reason I purchased this dress - it works well for that purpose) and am guessing my bra size to be a 36D, and there is no way I would wear this without something underneath. I wear a nursing bra that looks like a v-neck undershirt under it and it covers better that way. Then I pair it with a shrug and it looks nice.

The other issue I have with this design is that it's advertised as being red and white. It is so far from being red. It's pink, almost hot pink. I love the floral pattern and birds and everything else about the design, but I was seriously disappointed with the color and never would have bought it had I known it was pink. I just wear a red shrug over it and that makes the pink stand out less without clashing too much.

Essentially, it's a really nice dress if you know what to expect and work with it a bit. Not sheer (I tried a black bra under it and it did not show through), and very flattering. I actually bought another pattern of this dress a few weeks after buying this one because I liked the fit and design so much.","The fit on this is awesome, and I love the design",3.0,6040972467
"I am very pleased with this dress! I wasn't sure what size to get when I ordered it, so I got an XL (I'm about 5'7"" and weigh 210lbs). I was pleased to see that this has smocking in the back which gives it a bit of stretch. It is very comfortable, and is exactly the look I was going for. I will probably buy a couple more dresses from this brand, although I may go down a size as I am in the process of losing weight and would like to be able to keep wearing them.
I added a picture of the back of the dress, one without a petticoat, and the last picture is the dress with a petticoat. I bought ""Vintage Women's 50s Rockabilly Tutu Skirt Petticoat White(L)"" on Amazon to go with this dress.

"I didn't want to pay over $50 for a sports bra, but I really wanted a good product and the reviews promised that. So I shelled out the dough for one and they were right! It fits snug so there's no unwanted bouncing and it also prevents uni-boob. I ordered a different sports bra from Champion and this is by far my favorite of the two. The Champion one pushed my boobs in so much it made that ugly boob bump above the bra line that's visible in light t-shirts - ew - and they're supposed to be the same bra size so go figure.  More positives: this one also fastens securely (just start from the bottom and work your way up, it will fit!) and is super, super comfortable. I do wish the price were less so I could buy a second, but I'll have to put that in my budget.  Nevertheless, as a wannabe runner with a large chest, it was worth the investment in comfort and security.",Best I've Ever Owned,5.0,B000074RL3
"Finally. I've tried so many sports bras since my chest bloomed cantaloupes, I've lost count. This is the one. I will never, ever buy another brand / model of sports bra.

Be advised, getting into it the first time will be a struggle. Do the bottom-most hook and eye first, then position the breasts into the cups, then continue. There's no other way to do it. This is a TIGHT bra. It has to be, to immobilize comfortably.

If this bra had been available when I was in High School, I might have actually learned to enjoy sports--and I might have ended up a lot less klutzy.

"I bought my Enell about 4 months ago and it's been fantastic! I can't say enough good things about it. I used to have to wear 2 sports bras and even then I bounced and it HURT!

They do run very tight, but that's good because they get looser as you're exercising. At first I thought mine didn't fit because I was so squeezed in, but that just means that it fits perfectly. I can't say enough good about this bra.

"As an F cup I have been through MANY sports bras to find one that compresses, encapsulates and minimizes any bounce. I'm pleased to say that this more than meets my expectations. I have tried a few different ones since getting my first Enell but I keep coming back to this. If you want something designed for *high* impact then this should be your go to. This will take care of you while you do everything from burpees to jumping jacks to high knees. A lot of people do not like that the band can run tight but its designed to compress and support the breasts. I will grant you that they aren't the cutest design but if it worries you that much then throw a cute top on over it. You're there to work and this bra is there to support and protect you every step of the way while you do. Breast tissue is very delicate so don't risk injury or discomfort for the sake of looking good. You'll look and feel better being lean and fit without injuries. It is on the expensive end but consider it an investment that you won't regret. With proper care mine have lasted several years. Enell uses high quality material and its designed to last. From one woman to another, for the sake of your breasts invest in one of these.",An absolute must!,5.0,B000074RL3
"So, after hearing my daughter rave about this exercise bra I decided to buy one. I had been looking for something that would keep me motionless up top as I run and jump rope. I might add that I've never spent what amounts to the annual salary of a worker in an underdeveloped nation for one exercise bra. It's quite ridiculous especially when considering what I'm about to say...

Oh, don't get me wrong. It looks quite formidable--just like the pics, but au contraire. I was excited as I put her on for a test drive this morning. It looked pretty inconspicuous under my clothes-- a good sign I told myself. I walked a couple laps around the track then picked up my jump rope and proceeded to jump & JIGGGLLLLEE-- yes ladies-- jiggle. I'm reeeeaally disappointed because I'm rather shy and needed something that would allow me to jump rope sort of unnoticed while out in public. It looks like it'd probably serve well as a bust minimizer, but it's not my idea of a truly supportive exercise bra.
And, it's certainly not worth the $64 I paid.

To be even more candid, I get more support from my 12+ year old ""champion"" exercise bra! (I'm soo glad I've not disposed of it yet.)",...fries with that shake!!,1.0,B000074RL3
"I've been looking for a good sports bra for a long time.  I ride horses, and wear a 36DDD bra, so I need really good support when running/riding/doing anything more energetic than walking.  I've spent a fortune on sports bras looking for the right one, and I've found a lot of good ones.  This one is GREAT.  Really.  It's fantastic.

The Pros:
- Once you're in, you're in, and you're not going anywhere.
- The band isn't restrictive - it didn't impact my breathing like some bras do, and it is definitely more comfortable than wearing two (or three) sports bras at once.
- Having a front closure (versus just trying to shimmy your way into a sewn top with no closures) is essential in a sports bra for well-endowed women, and this one doesn't disappoint.
- It has a very high neckline, so the girls don't spill out of the top or sides.
- Super, supreme, amazing bounce control.  I don't feel like I'm being pornographic while exercising anymore.
- It MINIMIZES.  So for those of you who ride horses and are looking for a bra to help you fit into your show coat better, this is the bra for you.  No more gaps between my show coat or show shirt buttons!!!

The Cons:
- It's UGLY.  I don't mean cute little bulldog ugly.  I mean embarassing uncle you avoid at family reunions ugly.  You will not go running in a pair of capris and just this bra.  You will hide it with layers.  Ideally thick layers, because the seams are hideous.
- It takes an act of God and a willing partner to get into.  I was actively sweating by the time I got the thing on the first time.  I can usually get my husband to help now - A third arm is useful.
- The fabric looks and feels cheap, and I'm concerned it won't hold up over time.  I guess I shouldn't really list this as a con because it hasn't fallen apart or anything yet...I guess I just expect more quality for the price.

Overall, I highly recommend this bra.  It's the best I've found so far for the type of exercising I do, and the pros significantly outweigh the cons!",Best Sports Bra I've Found!,5.0,B000074RL3
"I tried this bra after the recommendation of a friend, and seeing it mentioned on a television program.  I don't like the underwire bras.  They have never fit me well, and usually, the wires work their way out,  But, I have rheumatoid arthritis, and I can't manage bras that clasp in the back.  I don't have the flexibility to reach back, or the strength to twist the bra to put the clasp in the back.

It fits more like the upper half of a tank top, and in the summer, it can be very warm.  It is heavy.  It is not a lightweight, thin fabric garment.  So, it isn't the bra I'd choose in July, on a 100 degree day, to go to an amusement park or outdoor activity, even though I know the back support would be wonderful.  But, inside, and the rest of the year... it is so comfortable....  and it provides support for my back.  I was astonished at the effect on my back.  Also, as other women have said, you DO NOT move.  At all.  It is wonderful support.  I was reluctant to spend the money when I could not try it on first.  I asked at area shops (the real undergarment ones), and oddly, no one had heard of them.  But, a friend was so adamant that I tried it.  As long as you take accurate measurements, you will be fine.  The charts are accurate.  They aren't frilly and fancy, but the frilly and fancy ones don't provide support to the front, or to my back, and who sees it under clothing?  Comfort is the goal.  I generally pay $50 for a bra, but, these last much longer than the front closure mastectomy bras I buy.  My only complaint is that they are heavy, but, without the construction, I'd have no back or chest support.",Excellent back and chest support,5.0,B000074RL3
"I used to double up on regular sports bras just to stop my boobs from giving me black eyes while running. I mean, it didn't work that well and not only would there be plenty of jiggle, it was also waaaay too hot. I'm a 34DD, and these changed my life. I'm not even exaggerating here -- this bra made exercising enjoyable and made it possible for me to do a lot of things that were once painful. Now, whenever I see another large breasted comrade run by, I wince at the sinusoidal motion of their boobs and I hope to myself that they are running to the store to get an Enell bra.

These hold your boobs in TIGHT. I can jump and there is zero movement. The material has very little give, so it's really important to get the right fit. I've pretty much always been a 34DD, even through weight loss and weight gain. I went with a size 1. At my heaviest, the size 1 felt a little constricting at the ribcage. As I lost some weight, it was very very comfortable, without sacrificing any of the hold. It will be really strange to put this on at first, but you'll get used to it. Sometimes, when I get back from the gym, I'll forget I have it on.

When I first got this, I was really concerned about breathability. At face value, the material and the AMOUNT of material makes it really daunting. However, I can assure you that these are absolutely breathable and you won't feel like you're drowning in your own sweat. I usually wear them for runs (3-5 miles), but I also used them a lot for hikes. I have gone on hikes over 20 miles with no issues. I even wore these guys when I climbed Kilimanjaro.

I don't really have anything negative to say about these, but I do have some advice. Be careful when you are washing these, as the hooks can get caught on things and it can also ruin the hooks themselves. I have four of these bras and I've had most of them for over two years now; only two of them have a few hooks on them that are a bit wonky because I wasn't careful when it comes to washing. ALSO, when I first started using these, I got two of them (they are rather expensive), but I would use them almost every day, and sometimes twice a day. I would just thoroughly hand wash these in my sink after a workout and hang them up to dry and they would be ready the very next day. This will save money and honestly, I think it helped my bras last longer by not putting them through the washing machine all the time. Lastly, I've noticed in the bras that I've bought, the sizes are not 100% consistent. I have a purple, a black, a pink, and a white bra. Out of all of them, the purple and black are the most comfortable. The pink one feels a lot smaller than the other ones. However, if you wear them enough, they do eventually stretch a bit and conform to your body.",Seriously life changing.,5.0,B000074RL3
"I love this bra. I am a competitive, thin, fit 44 yo with 34F busts so over the years certain body parts have moved a bit southward and there is a lot of potential for jiggling to outright flopping. In this Enell Sport Bra I can run and jump with no unwanted movement. It is a compression bra, so you are going to have a mono-boob, but it is the only bra I can run in that does the job without chafing. And when I am working out hard I'm a make-up-less, hair-puled-back, sweaty mess, so what do I care if I have one compressed motionless boob?

Most of the negative reviews of this bra are folks who couldn't get into it, so I figured I would tell you the easiest way:
1. First put your arms through the arm holes as though you were putting on a vest.
2. Leave your boobs where they are: if they are down by your lower rib cage, your belly button or tucked into your waistband, just leave there.
3. Grasp your Enell Sports Bra by the bottom two front clasps and lift up (vertically) so you are NOT pulling it across your boobs, but over the top of your boobs across your chest at arm pit height.
4. Hook the bottom to clasps so that the bra is closed at the bottom but contains no boobs.
5. Using your right hand, go through the inside of the bra and scoop up your left boob and pull it into the bra. Do the same with your left hand, right boob.
6. Arrange your boobs so they are comfortable and facing the same general direction, then easily hook the rest of the clasps from the bottom up.
Ta-Da!

I will say this is a LOT of bra. If you are a cup size C or smaller this may not be the bra for you. If you do not do a lot of high impact movements (running, jumping, karate, burpees, pogo-sticking) you probably do not need a bra this sturdy. For example, I do not need to wear my Enell when I am weight training or biking. However, if you are an older lady who maybe has had a couple of kids and gravity has done its thing, this may be the bra for you; or if you are a younger gal who is well endowed and have seen your mother naked and don't want the same fate to befall you, then you may want to wear a Enell to ward off the horrors of gravity for as long as possible.",How to get into your Enell Sports Bra,5.0,B000074RL3
"I admit that I am not as diligent as getting sized for a bra as often as we women should be.  I needed a strapless bra for a friend's wedding and went into a lingerie store to get one.  The measured me and announced I was a 34DD.  WHAT?!  I have never been a Double anything.. much less a D.  I will admit that for about 5 milliseconds I had a mixture of shock, and a strange sense of pride, but I digress...

With the friend's wedding looming near, I headed back to a workout schedule that had long been abandoned.  I went to bootcamp and trampoline fitness class and within 3 seconds of starting squat jumps, I was mortified that my DDs were flying all over the place.  Oh yeah.. I forgot to get a new sports bra since my girls grew exponentially!

I searched high and low on the internet, and this bra topped many lists as the best for larger-busted women.  I was hesitant to pay $64 for a sports bra, but SOMETHING needed to be done!  Thankfully, Amazon is quick with delivery (seriously, ya'll - the Prime membership is TOTALLY worth it).

I received it quickly and the first thing I did was try it on.  I put my arms through, and thought ""There is no way this thing is going to close up!  There must have been a mistake... Did I get the right size? Should I have ordered the next size up?""

The truth is it just looks like it won't fit, but it will.  Hook the bottom 2 first, adjust the girls a bit, and it should be easier to hook up the others up the front.

After that done, I jumped around, did some squat jumps, some burpees, and any other exercise that I could think of that extremely embarrassed me only days before because of my old sports bra.  NO MOVEMENT WHATSOEVER.  I was amazed.

The true test, I thought, would be making it through a trampoline fitness class since we are literally jumping up and down in different ways for an hour straight.  I am so impressed with this bra!  I am definitely going to buy more!

Cliffs Notes version of this item review:
1) It's awesome!  Don't even think twice, just buy it.
2) Go to the Enell website to find your size.  I used their measurements and it fit perfectly
3) To put it on, don't freak out.  Start with the bottom 2 hooks, adjust the girls, and hook the others.  Ta-Da!  You're ready to run or jump or whatever it is you want to do without your girls flying all over the place","HOLY COMPRESSION, BATMAN!!!!",5.0,B000074RL3

"This sports bra is the one if your a C cup or above. I am a DDD and never have I found a sports bra that can hold in the girls during cross fit and running. It is a bit uncomfortable to get on but, once one it is great! I have bought quite a few online and had to return them all because they just didn't hold up to anything more than walking.",Best ever!,5.0,B000074RL3
"Until I found the enell bra, there was just no way I could run. If I tried I hated it -- 32DD, it was uncomfortable and I could sense the damage running or jogging did to my breasts.

As soon as I put this bra on, I felt amazing. Suddenly 4+ lbs of weight was taken off my chest. I stood taller, and it immediately improved my posture. But most excitingly, I can run!! And I love it!! I can sprint in this bra and my breasts barely move at all. When I see other runners in the park, bouncing around all over the place I want to tell them ""YOU NEED THIS BRA!!"" but of course, I don't want to look like a madwoman, haha.

To get the best effect of the bra, you do need to go pretty tight, which for me is too tight to wear if I'm not running. I take it off straight after or it can feel restrictive. But not so restrictive that it effects my breathing while exercising.

I started on a size 0 (When I was probably more of a 34DD). I've now gone down to a 00 (I'm now 32DD-E -- yes, my breasts grew, eek). I like to wear the 0 still for low-impact exercise like pilates or using the cross-trainer at the gym. It's still effective. But for running I wear 00 to really feel locked in.

Honestly, I don't know where I'd be without this bra. I wouldn't have discovered my love of running and I wouldn't be anywhere near as active as I am today.",This bra changed my life and allowed me to run!,5.0,B000074RL3
"Tractors don't have suspensions so things get ridiculously bumpy. I drive a tractor 10 hours a day, 4 days a week so I give this thing a run for the money! People stare just because I'm a woman, no need to add bouncing boobs to the show! The first week I wore this was pretty rough. The lower elastic band hurt & my twisting to the right while driving 10k times per day caused chafing. I put a bandage over the chafing & continued wearing it. I wash it & hang it to dry at night so it's ready to go at 5am the next morning. I highly recommend visiting the manufacturer's website & measuring to make sure you order the correct size. The price is pretty high for a bra, but I have found that to get a good bra I have to spend about that much anyway. In order to get a good fit, I usually go to the high-end stores and endure a fitting that makes me feel as the fitter should've at least bought me dinner first. So it was nice to get a good fit without that experience. My triple Ds make me look larger than I am so I enjoy the lift & minimizing effect the bra gives. There is, however one MAJOR drawback. You can see in the picture a distinctive line on the bra where a standard bra would typically end. THIS IS VISIBLE THROUGH A SHIRT! That gives the look that I'm wearing some sort of fancy bustier or something. I've caught more than one guy staring. Remove that line & I'd give it 5 stars any day.",Perfect tractor accessory,4.0,B000074RL3

"I'm a 32F and I'm always on the hunt for a bra that can help my chest stay in place. I exercise 5-6 times a week and have an ever changing line up of bra's to support my bust.

This bra had amazing reviews so I thought that I would give it a shot. I found that the rib cage portion fit tightly as expected, but the cups are a bit roomy at the top. I used the Enell measurement system from their site and actually ordered a bit on the small side for my measurements.

I was hoping that this bra would out perform two staples in my line-up (Anita Extreme Control Sports Bra and Shock Absorber Women's Ultimate-Run Sports Bra). Sadly, I feel that my chest moves more in the this bra than in either of my other staples. Also I find that the stitching on the rib cage underneath my arms rubs and creates irritation. That combination has me leaving this bra in my drawer instead of on my body.

I'm not sure if I have the wrong size (though I don't think I could get the rib cage portion to close if I ordered any smaller) or not, but this bra has been a disappointment. I wanted so much for this to be my new staple bra. On to the next...

That said, I think that this bra could work well with a body shape different than mine.",Not as supportive as I was expecting,3.0,B000074RL3
"After reading massive reviews about this sports bra, I decided to take the financial plunge.  Plus, the other sports bras I use, my size was ALWAYS sold out at the store (Lane Bryant), and I've even had my online orders canceled because they were sold out.  I'm a pretty active (5-6 days a week) plus sized woman.  I do cardio at the gym, as well as a yoga sculpt class that is more HIIT type of workout.  With my other sports bras, there is a lot of bounce, even doing the elliptical machine.  When I have this sports bra armor on, there is nothing.  Maybe if I jump really fast I get a small amount of bounce, but nothing noticable!

So, getting into this thing is a feat, but its worth it.  All I could suggest is making sure you have it fitted properly on the arms and side before you start hooking it up because its not going to be moveable afterward.

**Edit/Update**
I just wanted to update this review, I've now accumulated 3 of these sports bras and have had them for the last 3 years.  Still look and perform NEW.  No loose threads, no rips, tears, nothing.  I wash them in the machine, then hang dry.  They are worth the money!!!!  I have a Livi by Lane Bryant sports bra that I've had for 2 years and it's stretched out and I barely use it because it hurts my shoulders.  The Livi bra is my ""oh F I forgot to wash my good sports bras"" sports bra.  So, it maybe gets 2 wears a month.  These get used 4-5 days a week, and washed weekly.  They fit as if I bought them yesterday.  LOVE ENELL!!",The Gymslayer,5.0,B000074RL3
"I have been looking for a sports bra that would keep the girls in place.  I searched through reviews and finally decided on this brand.  I love it.  It's more compression and gives you the uni-boob look... but, I'm working out so I don't care what I look like.  It fits *very* snuggly which I had to get used to.  I wear it during exercise and when I'm pretty active (deep cleaning the house, yardwork, etc).  I highly recommend this product for those of us that need the support!",Great for the girls!,5.0,B000074RL3
"Just ordered my fifth and sixth Enell bras and I will never, ever buy another sports bra.  I have tried hundreds (formerly a size 46DDD and currently a 36DDD) and not a single one has fit as comfortably or held the girls as firmly as my Enells.  Here's my two cents:

- Yep, they're ugly.  They peek out from some of my v-neck gym shirts.  The seams show through.  But, guess what?  I think everyone at the gym knows I'm wearing a bra and that it's probably a sports bra meant to support the girls.  So, I don't worry about it.  I buy the black and if it peeks out, so what?

- Enells are hilariously challenging to get into.  This is not a normal bra.  There's a lot of lifting and shifting to get the girls situated.  Definitely start hooking up from the bottom, reach in there and move those girls around until you're comfortable (my tip:  move them up and out to the sides).  It will give you a giggle but there won't be any wiggle.

- In my experience, buy for the band size.  My first Enell was bought for the breast size and it was uncomfortably snug, although it did loosen up during workouts as other reviewers have said.  I bought subsequent bras for the band size and was much happier.  Because the fabric has NO STRETCH, I find that even a slightly larger size still keeps the girls from bouncing and is extremely comfortable.  Again, this is not a normal bra.  DO NOT BUY IT BASED ON YOUR NORMAL BRA SIZE - FOLLOW THE FIT CHART ON THE ENELL.COM PAGE!  The bra definitely feels weird and even uncomfortable when you first try it on, but you will get used to the snugness and come to appreciate the total support this bra offers.

- Embrace the uni-boob.  My friends and I joke about the compression of this bra, but did I mention I will never, ever wear another sports bra?  I will happily sport the uni-boob during my runs if it means no pain!

Although I have worn Enells for years for all my workouts, I recently started running.  I wouldn't have even attempted to run in any other bra.  I cannot emphasize how comfortable the Enell is while exercising, how secure I feel in it, and how much it reduces movement of any kind in the boob area.  Totally worth the money and the only sports bra I will ever buy again!",I'll Never Buy Another Sports Bra,5.0,B000074RL3
"I ADORE this bra! And if I had more cash, I'd purchase enough to put a fresh one every day of the week, working out or not! I'm a SAHM, regular bra size 46DD and prefer sports bras while chasing around my three boys ages 5 and under. I need lots of support due to bust size and back problems and this bra delivers, along with comfort and breathability, which surprised me. And I like the color choices, given the ""Iron Maiden"" type bra that it is, LOL
It's sturdy, the hook and eye closures hold up well, a bit challenging to get on (TIP: try leaning forward and adjusting yourself into it as you go, hooking a couple hooks at a time), but well worth the money!",Excellent Bra! Go for it!!!,5.0,B000074RL3

I like the shape, it doesn't give me uniboob, it looks good under clothes.  It does have a seam that you can see through clothes, so that is kind of irritating.  But overall it looks so good I don't mind it.  I'll buy a couple more of these.  I wish I could find a daily bra that was shaped as cute as this one is.",I kind of love this bra,4.0,B000074RL3
"My title says it all.
I've always been pretty sporty and I developed early, so I've been searching for the perfect sports bra for a while now.  Oh, and FYI, perfect = no movement whatsoever.  I'm a D/DD so that was historically impossible to find so I just wore two sports bras simultaneously and just dealt with it until I found the Enell (aka Title Nine's ""Last Resort"" bra)

This bra revolutionized my workouts.  I rarely ran due to jiggle, now I can. An hour on a trampoline in Cardiolates class? No problem!  Granted this bra is not even remotely pretty, my sisters call it a ""straight jacket"", it's strictly for us utilitarians. (It works so well though, you won't care what it looks like.)

"I am a 38 F and I train for half marathons and marathons every now and then.  This bra works so much better than any other bra I have found.  The bounce factor is practically eliminated and somehow, it is snug, but not tight and manages to NOT pull on my shoulders (you know how you get those deep crease lines from where the elastic digs into your shoulder because it's trying to hold up too much weight?) or dig in.  I LOVE IT!",Far Outperforms any other!,5.0,B000074RL3
"First off with this review I want to give you my measurements. I am a 40D - small DD depending on the bra. My true rib cage size is actually 39. Based on Enell's sizing, I am a size 3 or at least comfortable in a size 3. Anyway on to the juice!!
I bought this bra because I wanted to do a couch to 5k type of program. I'm on the heavier side (I wear an XL) and experience the dreaded boob bounce. I HATE boob bounce. I just can't deal with it and it has gotten so painful with non-supportive Walmart sports bras in the past that I have literally duct taped my boobs down. This bra? It straight jackets your boobs down. There are 11 hook and loop eyelets in the front that seal you into this bad girl. If spending that much time strapping/stuffing your boobs in may annoy you, you may want to look elsewhere. A tip I want to give to all ladies out there is when you first try out this bra, stand up, bend at your waist like you would touch your toes, and shake your boobs into the cups. You will feel more comfortable and notice a difference in the fit versus just strapping yourself in and running out the door. Expect it to be a tight, not painfully tight or bothersomely tight but you will always know your boobs are there and not moving because of this awesome bra. Also I haven't had a single hotspot develop. The bra is higher riding under your arms versus a regular bra but is very smooth in my opinion so there isn't anything to annoy you. Keep in mind that the cups aren't padded so if you are running outside and things get chilly you may want a hoodie to coverup with. This is such an amazing high quality bra and I can't recommend it enough.

So rejoice fellow big boobied girls - you can do jumping jacks without flopping or bouncing!",Bye Bye Bounce!,5.0,B000074RL3
"I'm not sure how anyone can complain about this bra.  I have tried EVERY bra for running/high impact sports and this is the ONLY bra that stops bouncing.  Is it pretty?  No.  Is it comfortable? No.  Do I wear it when I'm not running? NO!  It smashes your boobs so flat that they cannot bounce when running, and it is a horror to put on, but it WORKS!  I am a 32DDD, no kids or plastic surgery, and finding a bra that allows me to run outside without being embarrassed about the ""show"" I'm giving every car that drives by....PRICELESS.  I put it on right before I run and take it off right after I return (otherwise it chafes me in the front).  I wash it in the machine on gentle and hang it dry; it's worth every penny and I am buying another today.",The best running bra available,5.0,B000074RL3
"Like everyone here, I had high hopes of FINALLY finding the ""Holy Grail"" of sports bras! No more wearing 2 sports bras to work out! No more uni-boob (from the ""lift and separate"" look of the picture). I followed the instructions that came with it...everything lined up where it was supposed to before hooking, hooking from the bottom up, adjusting your breasts from the top to get them into place.  The first thing I noticed was that the center seam cut into my breast so it looks like they're split in half horizontally. Not attractive but oh well...I bought it not to bounce! And...unfortunately it didn't do that either. I, too, did the ""bounce test"" and sure enough...the girls were bouncing up and down too. Now I have a fairly large chest (40DD) but compared to some of the reviewers who had amazing results, that's child's play! THOSE are the reason why I bought this one! So not only do I still bounce just as much as the 2-bra method, I have the uni-boob AND the weird seam bisecting them. Three strikes...you're out. I'm not even going to attempt to do my typical workouts (P90x, Insanity, Running).",Disappointed,1.0,B000074RL3

"I've been wearing two bras every time I run:  the Lululemon Tata Tamer and the Anita Sports Bra because it's the only way to keep my boobs from bouncing around.  Then my friend told me about the Enell Sports Bra and I ordered it from Amazon.  Well, I did a test run today (4 miles) and it is awesome.  This bra firmly holds everything in place!  It's a relief not to have to wear two bras anymore.  The only drawbacks (aside from the appearance) is: (1) it's very tight around the rib cage, so I had to wear it with the first/bottom hook unhooked and (2) it feels like you are wearing a breastplate - so, it looks a bit awkward underneath thin, workout shirts.  Also, because this bra is very form fitting and restrictive, it's not one of those sports bras where you can wear all day.  Overall, It is the best running bra available for bigger chested women.  I'm 5'0, weigh 120lbs, 34D and the size 00 was perfect for me.","Yes, it's ugly but it's the best running bra out there!",4.0,B000074RL3
"I really am pleased with this bra so far. I do have a large bust so it has always been a struggle to find something that will hold me in and keep my breasts from bouncing about when I workout. I just had my second baby so I needed something more heavy duty. I did the bounce test of jumping jacks and jogging in place and am amazed how well everything stayed put.

I did a lot of research for a sports bra and read the reviews for this one. Yes it does give you a Uni boob, but so do a lot of other sports bra. Not to mention I wouldn't wear this bra around if I weren't working out.

Not crazy about the color I got, but I plan on buying more once the baby weight starts to come off.",Very pleased,5.0,B000074RL3
"I recently had a baby and needed to get some sports bras for ""large-breasted"" women.  After doing some research and asking friends, I wound up purchasing one Anita Momentum in 34G, 3 Panache Sport in 34F (UK sizing is slightly different, 34F UK = 34G USA), and one Enell in size 1.

Initially I liked the Panache bras the best (that's why I ended up with 3).  While the Enell provides the very best support (your girls are not going ANYWHERE in an Enell), it's fugly.  The Panache and the Anita provide similar support to one another, and are both more attractive than the Enell.  I found the support of the Panache bras slightly better than the Anita bra.  The Panache bras are also somewhat padded, which gives a nice smooth look (no nipple outlines when you're cold).

Over time, though, as my milk supply evened out, my breasts dropped several sizes, and the Panache and Anita bras no longer fit, while the Enell did.  The Enell has so much compression that it can accommodate fluctuating breast sizes.  That means it ended up being the only bra that I am still using.

In summary - I consider the Enell to be the best bra of the bunch.  Too bad it's so unattractive.  :/

P.S.  All 3 bras are roughly the same price, unless you can find one of them on sale.","Comparison by a new mom - Anita, Enell, Panache",5.0,B000074RL3

"Yes, this bra is very tight, yes, it smooshes you as flat as possible giving you the uniboob look -- I call it the Boob Masher 5000, or ""Chinese foot binding for boobs"".  But that's WHY it works, because it binds the breasts snugly to the ribs... if you are large breasted (I'm 38DDD) you will not find a bra that keeps the breasts prettily separated AND keeps them from bouncing.  There's just too much mass.  I wear this for hiking, jogging, horseback riding (from short 5-10 mile rides through 25 and 50 mile endurance rides), and when I am on the tractor which bounces me to death over our bumpy ground.  The breasts still jiggle a little but they do not painfully bounce.  I need to order a size 3 because I am still squeezing into my old size 2, leftover from when I was 36DD.  Since there is no sizing info for this particular bra on amazon, go to the Enell website's sizing guide.  If the stock bras do not fit, you can also custom order from them to have shorter straps or a smaller band with larger cup size, etc.  You can even custom order an asymmetrical color combo with different colors on different parts of the bra.

For those who have trouble getting into this bra, you are supposed to start hooking from the bottom and work your way up, redistributing the breast tissue as needed.

For those who are complaining about how the bra looks, decide whether you want to actually work out comfortably, or look cute but be in pain.  Why are you worried about the bra top showing above a low-necked shirt, or the seams showing under a tight shirt, when you are (theoretically) sweating like a horse in Zumba class or on the elliptical anyway?  Wear a higher-necked or looser shirt, for Pete's sake.

"By far the best stockings I have found. They are great quality, don't snag or run easily and are uniform in color with no weird lines running through them. Stockings with the rubber/silicone grips at the top always cut into my thigh and leave an unsightly bulge (think muffin-top for your legs). They never stay up that well either. I prefer using these with a grater slip anyways. I appreciate that these don't have the lace trim on top that can irritate my legs are these are great for vintage pin-up photo shoots. I wore these for a boudoir photo shoot and the photographer asked me what brand they were and plans on ordering them to keep on hand at the studio for clients to use because it's so hard to find simple, traditional style stockings that are made to last.

"First of all, I want to say that the picture used for this product doesn't do the model or the bra justice.  The picture almost scared me off, but I really really really wanted to find a 3/4 long line bra to wear, so I took a chance and ordered this one.  I am large chested, and my shoulders are started to get grooves from my traditional bras.  I wanted to find a everyday bra that provides a lot of support.  I tried the goddess long line bra, but it is more of a special occasion bra.

The sizing is very strange for this bra.  I normally wear a 36DD, but ordered a 38D, since no larger cup sizes are offered.  Was I ever shocked to find in this bra I would be considered a C cup.  I returned the 38D and believe the 38C will fit me great (I'm still waiting for it to arrive). When I tried on the 38D I couldn't believe how comfortable it was.  Definitely comfortable enough to be an everyday bra.

So all you ladies that normally wear a larger cup size can fit into this bra!  I would suggest ordering a band size larger, and maybe two cup sizes smaller than you normally wear.  I will update when my new one arrives.",Don't let the picture dissuade you...,4.0,B0000861QJ

"I bought a band size up and a cup size down as suggested.  Had I bought my usual size it would *definitely* have been too small around.  The cups are a tiny bit small, but not too bad.  They are, however, just as pointy as other reviews suggest.  For wear with vintage clothing ('30's-50's), this is close to ideal for the short and/or short-waisted, but would probably look funny under any but the baggiest of t-shirts. For average height or taller people, this might be too short in the waist to give the right look for close-fitting vintage styles.

If you are about 5' this will probably come all the way down to your waist.  If you are under 5', or under 5'1"" and short-waisted, this will actually be too long.  I'm 5'2"" and short waisted.  With the straps shortened all the way, I can just get away with wearing this.  Halfway through the day, I had to pull it up in the back, because the boning in the back/sides started to rub on my backside and sides.",Good for short (or short-waisted) people intending to wear vintage styles,3.0,B0000861QJ
"Sizing way off and not comfortable rolls up a lot  - Having said that, I recommend the Carnival Womens Full Figured Wide Strap Longline Bra - the only issues with this particular bra is that you will have to do a little sewing because the straps don't tighten up enough and order a band size up and a cup or two sizes down.

"When I asked Amazon customers for suggestions for comfortable, front-close brassieres for an impending breast cancer/reconstruction surgery, they really came through! Thank you, ladies. This bra was a top suggestion. While no bra will feel good after breast surgery, this one was very comforting. It was thin, light, very soft and didn't rub too much. Good for sleeping. It kept everything in place and didn't mess with the drains. It was easy to put on and remove. It has been great for post op checkups/nurse visits  when you have to unveil frequently. I would suggest this bra to anyone who will undergo breast cancer/reconstruction surgery. May I recommend: you might want to consider getting one in black or another dark color to wear in the days immediately after surgery. My white one soon got heavily stained beyond the power of bleach (which is to be expected, its not the bras fault!). The black ones still look like new after many washings and they are so comfortable I plan to keep wearing them after I fully recover. The only downside of the black bra is that some very fine black cotton lint got stuck to the surgical tape residue and steri strip glue which looked extra gross in between showers.

"I absolutely love this slip. I am a size 38 D in the chest and and 5'2 and about 200lbs. I was worried about the sizing of this slip because I have never ordered one online before. I ordered a size 42 and it fits perfect. It has good length to it, just below the knees and is very silky and comfortable. The thing that I love most about it are the straps. Because they are lace I thought it would feel like lace but it doesnt. It actually is made from a stretchy material so it shapes to your shoulders and doesnt get itchy like most lace does. I plan on buying more of these in the future.",Perfect Slip,5.0,B0000865SC

"My one remaining boob does not stay in the bra.  It slips out below!  I have never had this happen before, and though the band is comfortable, I don't think it is too big.  Maybe it is just me.  It feels very comfortable until I look in the mirror and see a bulge below the bra!  The straps do not adjust, and I am not sure what to do.  I am 65, and I had a mastectomy when I was 42.  I am 5'2"", 125 pounds.  I am mostly comfortable in 36 bras with a C cup.  I think because by now gravity has overtaken me, and the radiation I received so many years ago has made me a rather odd shape.  I am 10 - 15 pounds heavier than when I had my mastectomy.  So when I say this might just be my experience, these are the reasons why.","Maybe it's me, but my boob falls below the bra.",2.0,B0000862R1

"Comfortable, supportive, easy to put on after surgery when you can't lift your arms. It is soft with gentle support, so wearing it 24 hrs is not a problem.  The pale lavender print on white is quite attractive.  Will have to see how the support and appearance hold up over time.  My complaint is the price.  There is little difference in the amount of material to make a bra, regardless of size.  The cost of any bra is in the labor to cut and sew the many pieces.  Again, the pieces and sewing are much the same for any size.  Yet this manufacturer charges a premium for the larger sizes.  If you have had breast surgery, you may find that the post-op swelling puts you into a larger size.  This is when some become aware of the size discrimination.  Try the YIANNA for a good bra at a reasonable price.",NICE BUT PRICEY,4.0,B0000862R1

"This is a wonderful solution for fuller figures, as the pointy shape provides a flattering look.  Anyone looking for a Mad Man figure should consider this piece of equipment.

My only complaint is that mine came mislabeled - I ordered 36 and got 38 with a paper tag that said 36.

"I've been trying to find a replacement for the Goddess 1304.  Thought I'd try this bra because it seems similar enough. I'm not too impressed. I don't think this is a bad bra. I just don't think it suits my needs.  Here's why:

I have back fat. I need to flatten said back fat. While it sort of did that, it created a whole new roll of back fat above the band. The band seemed be lower in the back. However, I compared it to my other bras and the band seems the same width and shape, so I don't know.  I didn't have the luxury of trying before I bought.  Admittedly, the issue might just be that I bought a size too small. Just mentioning it in case any other women with a similar body issue were thinking of purchasing. If you can, definitely try before you buy to make sure.

My main issue, however, is the straps. They just don't get tight enough. I shortened them as much as they would go, and it just wasn't enough.  I was visibly sagged in the front. If I can reach up and tighten straps with my hands and lift my girls, it's not a good thing. I didn't think it was very supportive. If you need a tighter strap to keep yourself up, I would not go with this bra.",Eh,2.0,B0000862B7

-Not restrictive,binding or pinching. Some side to side movements are out but that is the way all long lines or corsets are made.
-Not itchy.
-Spectacular Amazon shipping!
Here are my criticisms:
-The cups are a little outdated in style-Marilyn Monroe-ish and pointy, oh well, there are worse things to look like.
-Back closures require a second person to help you. If you live alone, you would want a front closure.",Love It!,5.0,B0000862B7

"There are things that I like about these, but for the most part, they were a huge disappointment. I like that they didn't feel as though I were being squeezed by a Boa Constrictor... they had a nice, comfortable top that I could wear all day at work.

HOWEVER, as other customers have pointed out, they don't last nearly as long as they should, especially if they are really made out of nylon. I got three pairs of these: one tan pair and two black pairs. The tan pair I wore twice and the second day I noticed two large holes where the normal nylon legs attach to the crotch area. Needless to say I was disappointed. The very next day I wore a pair of the black ones and when I got to work in the morning realized there was already a couple picks that turned into runs as the day went on. These are a rip-off. I figured Hanes would have good quality nylons, but unfortunately they do not.

"Things I like about these stockings... #1 they are actually my skin tone... As I have gotten older (I'm in my early 30s) I have embraced my fair skin tone and I try to avoid getting too much sun (and my legs never tanned anyway). I have always bought the barely there color, because in stores it usually is the lightest color. This has always baffled me quite a bit because I don't really view myself as being pale, or porcelain... I even have a couple of friends with fairer skin.. but I was SO pleased with this color. They look nude on my skin.

Things I don't like about these stockings. I have only been able to wear each pair 2-3 times before they are just shredded. I'm not sure why this is happening, I buy other hanes stockings and don't have this issue, but the material feels less silky and all of a sudden I just get a big hole and there is no option of just spraying hairspray or putting a dab of clear nail polish to stop the run for the remainder of the day. As a bonus: since the stockings are so close to my skin color, it is barely noticeable when I get these catastrophic runs.

The stockings I have been sent are definitely not control top.... The package says they are... but these just feel like regular stockings at the waist...

This review started out as a 4, because that is how much I love the color... but based on the limited times I can wear them and not living up to their product description, I knocked it down to 3 stars... (If the color wasn't so fantastic it would only be 2 stars though). I wear stockings every week day... I can't afford to pay $8 every 2-3 days to keep me in stockings.",Things I like about these stockings,3.0,B0000891KM

"I needed some nude tights to match my ballet Halloween costume. As an African-American, finding nude anything can be challenging because the colors are often way too light or too brown for my complexion. However, these fit the bill even though they are just a little too dark to match my skin. My skin tone is close to Nicole Richie or Meagan Markle and these tights coordinate. For fit, the smallest size works well.  I am 51 tall and weigh around 100 lbs. Most womens tights are too baggy in the hips or very thin. These are neither. They are also well-made and not ripped anywhere despite washing them in the washer by mistake.  For about $8 a pair, Im satisfied.

"Another Great Fantasie Bra! I've been wearing the 4510 and 4520 for about 20 years. They're the only Fantasie bras I'd ever worn. After breast reduction surgery I went from a 32F to a 32D. I thought that I'd try a different Fantasie bra and this one really delivers. Like the others, it has great support. It's true to size. I like how the straps angle in toward my neck a little which will allow me to wear tank tops in the summer without having my bra straps show. Some reviewers complained that the bra is a little revealing because the cup material isn't thick enough. So far I haven't noticed it. But, this is winter and I'm wearing lots of layers over the bra which is black. I'll probably know more about that in the summertime when I wear the tan bra with thinner tops. But if it's a problem I'll just buy the Nippies nipple covers from Amazon that some reviewers have bought. It sounds like the perfect solution.

The lace at the top is about 5 inches, which I personally adore. The lace however, does have a sticky plastic on the inside to keep the stockings up that could be constricting for individuals with larger thighs.

"These were sealed in plastic and obviously brand new, so I was rather surprised that the fabric had a strong perfume scent.  After a wash and dry cycle, the scent persists.  It seems the manufacturer has determined that a deodorant was in order...?  Strange, given that we also got Jockey briefs for men another time and they were definitely not scented.  So wow.  Way to turn off fragrance-allergic customers.  I'm kind of surprised nobody else has mentioned the perfumy smell in the reviews, so maybe this was a new thing or one-off.  Possibly I could be convinced that a permanent scent could be miraculously imparted to the cloth through the plastic by accident.  Maybe.  But I'm not going to take the chance.  I'll stick with other  choices.

Update: Turns out there is at least one other review that warns of the scent.  I should have looked at all of them before buying! It truly didn't occur to me that they might be bathed in fragrance at the point of manufacture.

Update: 4/25/2014 - Just to update things, I've washed this underwear 5 or 6 times since I got it, and the scent is still strong.  It's just not fading.  They were so pretty and nicely constructed, I kept them, hoping the fragrance would go away, but now I see that wasn't a very bright idea.

My only complaint is that in my last shipment, the sizes were off a bit.  One pair was definitely larger than the other two.  Part of that seems to have been that the fabric was slightly different and sizing was closer after laundering.  However, this was a very slight adjustment.

"I was debating between a 1 and 2 star rating.  These Jockey briefs are good quality, but Jockey has a sizing problem between sizes 7 and 8.  I first ordered 3 size 8s and they are somewhat large so went back on Amazon, checked the sizing charts then ordered 3 size 7s.  There is at least 2 or more inches difference in the width of these two sizes and the 7 is more than an inch shorter.

However, I have worn a size 7 for many years and they have fit beautifully; but this order fits more like a size 6 than a size 7 (even though I have lost weight since I last purchased them)......so that's not the problem....they just seem to be cut too small;  I measured them up against my older pants and they are definitely smaller....but they are marked size 7 both on the inside label in the pants and on the outside packaging....so I feel that the problem is that they were made too small.

"The stockings had a strong but hard-to-define odor when I opened the packaging.  For want of a better word, I'll say ""musty"", but that doesn't truly describe it.  It was offensive, but not as bad as that word might conjure up.  The box said they were made in El Salvador.  I washed them, but they still exuded an odor, so I aired them for several days before stowing them.  When I finally decided to try them on, they still smelled strange, only now it was coming from me!  They didn't feel like the same material of my other Sheer Energy stockings that I bought long ago.  The new ones felt looser in the ankles and tighter near the top of the thighs, even though I am lean (and my older pairs feel fine).

The lack of stretch meant that this extra material pooled at my ankles in wrinkles.  No amount of pulling them up corrected this problem for very long.

"History/Experience:
I have struggled to find a good sports bra for my large chest since I was in middle school. Growing up playing soccer really made it hard to adjust when things started bouncing more. My mom (being smaller busted) also struggled to help me find a solution. Keep in mind, this was before the internet/google/amazon days. I finally settled on ""doubling-up"" when getting ready for a game or practice - which was a daily occurrence. Looking back now, that was terrible. I could barely breath correctly, getting in and out of two very tight bras was a nightmare not to mention quite embarrassing.  So, playing soccer ended soon after I became more full-figured.

Recently (at age 23) I started running, having my new sports bra from the sporting store, made ""specifically for larger breasts"". Well, that was a crock. Sorry, but bras off the shelf just don't cut it. After researching and reading about several of the newer sports bras on the market, I decided upon the Enell. I was careful not to get my hopes up too much however, because I didn't I could ever wear something that truly cut out the bouncing, but I remained hopeful. I measured, remeasured and finally ordered my new bra. As soon as it came, I had to go run around the neighborhood to give it a try. Oh, the joy of running!

The Real Product Review:
I am VERY HAPPY with the Enell. I can finally jog/run and truly enjoy what the sport has to offer, without worrying about hurting myself or being out of breath from non-stop chest thumping! The bra is quite tight but I think that is a necessity. I still move a little bit but since my breasts are held very close/tight to my chest, the up and down motion is very minimal. It took a few days of getting used to but now I love putting on my Enell (I always lay down to hook the clasps - much easier!) I love the tight feeling across my back when I am wearing it. I have even worn it all day at the zoo and other family activities. So easy, so comfy and SO worth every penny. The greatest thing, I don't have think twice when chasing the toddler! I don't have to worry anymore about wanting to enjoy an impromptu game of frisbee or catch at the park. I can run and play with the kiddos comfortably and confidently.

I would recommend the Enell to anyone with a larger bust that is tired of having to deal with improper support, doubling-up and not being able to breath, having constant chest-thumping when exercising, or just wants to feel better when playing with their kids. It has truly become one of my most essential pieces of clothing. As for the price: Yes, it seems expensive for a sports bra, but seriously, how much did you pay for your gym sneakers? I believe that this is just as essential to your workout wardrobe as your shoes. Maybe more since there are plenty of things you can do barefooted! Try it, feel the difference, find your stride, and go for it. You will be amazed at the difference proper support makes on your entire workout, attitude, and confidence! I have been using this bra for over 4 months now and still love it.

Note: I launder my bra in a lingerie bag (to wash and dry). It keeps other clothing from getting tangled in the clasps and ripping them out. This is a good trick for all of your bras since the larger size you need, the more expensive  they are! Also, I dry mine in the dryer since that helps to ""shrink it back up"" after use. So far, I have never had a problem and I'd say I have washed it well over 100 times using the lingerie bag.",A true lifesaver!,5.0,B000093AIC
"I have large breasts, larger than some but not the largest, 40 DDD. This bra did not even pass the bounce test. I put it on and jumped up and down. FAIL. I like to run and do Turbo Jam and even Zumba, but with the way this bra is I doubt it would have even held up to my Zumba classes. Back to the drawing board. Does anyone know of any great support/sprt bras out there?!",Does not work as intended,1.0,B000093AIC
"I like being active and find that there are very few sport bras that work to minimize the bust, reduce the bounce and support a large bust. Also, it shapes the bust so you don't look like you have ""uni-boob"" like some of the other sports bras. Enell fits perfectly and is perfect for intense cardio like walking, running, cross training and biking. When I hook into the bra (there are many hook and eyes), I feel like I'm locking myself into equipment but it allows me to be comfortable while working out. No more 2 bras or bra plus snug sport tank top. I don't wear this bra when I'm doing yoga or pilates because the compression makes it harder for me to breathe in this bra. Overall, great bra and very durable after many washings.",This is THE sports bra!,5.0,B000093AIC
"I was impressed with this bra. It has enabled me to exercise more freely without being worried about my breast excessively bouncing around and having to constantly readjust my bra. Even though I like this bra, I only gave it three stars because it appears that I am in between sizes. Initially, I ordered a size four which fit fine but it was a little loose and wasn't quite as supportive as I would have liked it to be. I still had a little bounce while exercising.  Despite the slight bounce, this bra did provide a lot more support than the average sports bra. I exchanged the size 4 for a size 3. The size 3 was perfect as far as being supportive and eliminating bounce while exercising. However, my breasts tend to spill out a little at the top which meant I constantly had to stop in the middle of my workout to readjust my bra.  If they made a size 3 1/2 I would have the perfect fit. Despite my sizing issue, I highly recommend this bra.  It is by far the best sports bra that I have used.  I purchased another one because I liked it so much.

Update July 2014:  I purchased this bra two years ago.  I originally only gave it three stars, but after two years I have to say that this is definitely the best sports bra that I have ever owned.  It is also the longest lasting bra that I have owned too.  I can't believe that it has held up so well after two years.  I work out on average 3 to 4 days a week and this sports bra has stood the test of time.  Purchasing this sports bra was definitely a good investment.",Good Bra,4.0,B000093AIC
"I've got to say that for the money this bra is kinda meh.  There's no adjustment for the shoulder straps and the support is just ok, not bad, but not really all that great.

"I bought my first Enell sports bra over 10 years ago based on a recommendation from a friend.  I am just now having to replace it!  Finally after all of these years one of the eyehooks has come loose and it is starting to look a little ragged, but still functions!  I just bought a new one and am pleased to find that the quality appears to be the same as the first.

I am a 42D and like to exercise - going to the gym, and doing CrossFit-style exercise.  I have tried conventional sports bras, even doing the double-bra thing and nothing works like Enell.  It takes a little getting used to at first and almost feels too tight, but it supports and holds like nothing else.  I can do jumping jacks, jogging, running - and it is not uncomfortable at all!  I won't say there is zero movement or bounce, but it is so minimal it is almost unnoticable.

"I'm a 40DDD and for years, I had been searching for a sports bra that kept my girls under control. I had resorted to wearing two underwire bras, a (relatively cheap) sports bra, and tank tops with a shelf bra in them. Even with all that, these Enell bras far out performed my previous method. They're almost like wearing a corset, but you can breathe in them! I highly recommend to any large chested woman who wants some real support!

As far as sizing goes, you can look on their website. When I was a 38DDD, I wore a size 3 in Enell size. And now that I'm a 40DDD, the 4 fits me better (although, I'm hoping to go back to the 3s soon!!)

"First, let me say that I have NEVER spent $60 on a bra before.
I am a 38DD-40DD and ordered the size 4.
OMG ... I am in love!

I have worn Playtex 4693 (Playtex 18 Hour Original Comfort Strap Wirefree Bra) for years ... probably 20 years. I love that bra - especially the wide straps and high(er) sides so I don't have side ""spillage.""

I bought the Enell bra because I wanted a sports bra that
1) fit  - Victoria's Secret is NOT for large busted girls
2) I could potentially use as a swim bra under my rash guard

As soon as I put this bra on, I said to myself, ""OMG, this is the most comfortable bra ever.""
I was so impressed, I actually considered SLEEPING in it!
I did decide to wear it to work the next day to see how I felt after a full day of wear.
I'm still in love.

The one thing I'm not thrilled about is how it smooshes my breasts and makes me just look ""thick.""
At least the Playtex made my breasts look like breasts.
HOWEVER, this is a SPORTS bra - it's meant to hold those girls and so, it does that excellently.
I do have a little movement and bounce, but this bra is comfortable. I just cannot say that enough.
I don't think I'd fit into a size 3, but maybe someday.  ;-)",The most comfortable bra I've ever worn!,5.0,B000093AIC
"It's pretty comfortable, but something changed since the last one I bought?  I bought one originally that had NO bounce.  I then apparently went on a 2 year eating spree and needed to size up a size because the girls were popping out of the sides of the smaller bra.  Now there is a lot of space above the seam on the front, as though the shoulder straps are too long and there is nothing I can really do about it.  I'm using it and it works better than any other sports bra on the market, but there is definitely bounce because of the way it fits above the seam.  It's only a small gripe though.

Oh, yeah.  It does give you uniboob but it's a small price to pay for the girls being locked in place for the most part.","Super comfortable, never feels damp.",4.0,B000093AIC
"I so wanted this bra to be ""the one"", but unfortunately I was very disappointed. First, let me be clear... my breasts are truly a force to behold. I mean, I'm a 38H and it takes a nation of millions to hold them down - or so it seems.  I have had a Freya and Wacoal underwire sports bra that have worked very well in the past, so I know it can be done. When I saw the reviews and the description for this bra, I felt like it might be yet another wonderful one that I could add to the arsenal.  But it was absolutely NOT that bra.  I read tons of reviews regarding the fit and how to measure and I measured myself and purchased a 4.  I was smack in the middle of what should have been a size 4 based on my measurements.  When I received the bra I put it on and the band was obviously the right size, It was difficult to fasten across my breasts - so tight I thought at first it may have been too small, but I was able to fasten the bra and then stuff my breasts into it - maybe not the way they intended to get it on, but hey - whatever works.  When I had it on and positioned my breasts in the cups the first thing I noticed was the significant lack of coverage and spillage out the sides of the bra. I also had monoboob and spillage out of the top. It was just not big enough to contain my breasts. The problem is a size bigger and it would have been way too big in the band.  Also, it had no adjustable straps. I thought it was brand new, and the band was pretty tight, so let me try it out and see how it goes.  So I wore it to my morning workout with my trainer and it was just useless.  It loosens up super fast and I was just bouncing around like a pogo stick. I mean when he said run and give me high knees, he got high breasts too. My breasts were like, ""Seriously?  This is no help at all.""  That's what they said to me after the workout.  I have already worn it so I won't return it.  I guess what I'll do is wear a regular bra under it and wear it on top.  Like so many other times, I end up wearing two bras so as not to waste the money I spent on some inept, unsupportive joke of a bra that my breasts just roll their eyes and shake their head at. Sigh.

Probably the only complaint I've got is the horizontal mid-boob seams. They show through just about any t shirt. Very expensive too.

"I was looking for something to wear under a ball gown to help keep my post-baby-belly from being too noticable as well as hold up the girls. I ordered the bust one size larger and the rib cage one size smaller and it fits very well. It's nice and tight under my breasts so it doesn't slide down, but not as tight as I wanted around my lower belly. The plus side is that since it's not too tight at the bottom, there is nothing getting ""squeezed out"" the bottom. The item is very pretty, it comes with removable garter straps, but no garters. The boning is not uncomfortable but is thick enough that it will show through any smooth garment. All-in-all I'm happy with it.","Not quite what I wanted, but still works",4.0,B0000CBXEI

I can easily pinch about 2 inches of extra fabric from the sides of this bustier. I will be returning this bustier, and I have already reordered the same one but 2 band sizes down and a cup up, so a 34DD.

"I got these on a bit of a whim, needing more workout shorts but tired of all bike shorts all the time.  I'm pleased enough that I'll probably pick up another pair.

Good length - not down to the knees, but not so high the thighs chafe.  Good fabric thickness - thin enough to stay fairly cool while exercising in the hot, humid summer in Houston, but thick enough to not show off the color of my undies.  It is a bit thicker and warmer than my bike shorts, but not so much as regular sweatpant material would be.

The dropped-look wide waistband is flattering, and there's a drawstring about an inch down that can be tied if you're doing something extra-energetic and are afraid the shorts might slip or be pulled down.  They're a little snug on the top, but not so much as bike shorts.  The bottoms are a little loose, but not so much that they ride up much, if at all.

My only complaint on these is that the slash pockets gape pretty badly due to their positioning.  But hey, at least they have pockets, even if they're not super-deep!

"Since growing DDs over the summer before 8th grade, I've struggled to find a bra with straps that stay on my shoulders. Screw those mean girls that say, ""you just aren't wearing the right bra."" Uhhh, no. I've been fit by the professionals at Nordstrom, Victoria Secret, and some fancy-pants lingerie houses with no luck. Within a few weeks, my bra straps slip, no matter how much I tighten them. Turns out, I have narrow shoulders and have met many narrow-shouldered ladies with the same problem (you know who you are--over the shoulder purses can also be problematic).  Wacoal's T-back bra solves that problem! After I had my baby, my breasts just did not return to what they used to be. When my son turned one, I had to suck it up and buy a new bra size. I liked the everyday design of this Wacoal bra, with a T-back with a front clasp. Sounds cool, right? After wearing this bra for a few weeks here are a few observations:
*Wacoal's T-back design has a regular bra strap shape, but the straps attach to the back strap closer to the center, almost making a V. There is a few inches gap between the straps, keeping them two completely separate straps. So it isn't a true T-back like the Maidenform bra, which looks more like a racerback bra. I like this style better than a true ""T"" shape, because it doesn't make the skin between my shoulder blades itch. It does pull a little on your shoulders near your neck, which only bothered my shoulder with a trapezius injury after an 8 hour day. My uninjured shoulder did seem to be bothered by the pull.
*The bra is made of very thin, stretchy fabric, which I personally like. I know that some women don't feel thin fabric offers good, full support. I haven't had a problem with support in this bra. But the thin fabric does NOT give you good nipple coverage, so if you are wearing a thin shirt beware you could ""nip out.""
*Some women have complained this bra feels cheap because of the thin fabric, thin feeling underwire, and it's small, cheap-feeling front clasp. When I pulled this bra out of the bag, I could totally understand why. The front clasp is small, and if you aren't careful I can see how you could break it. Despite it's size, once on the bra has stayed in place and provided support through an 8-12 hour work day running around a hospital. The clasp has yet to break or fail and un-clip. I'll update this review if anything like that happens, but after a few weeks of use, so far so good.",PERFECT IF BRA STRAPS ALWAYS FALL OFF YOUR SHOULDERS!,5.0,B0000ZBSP6

These will be OK under dresses but def. do not work under skinny jeans.  The legs did ride up.  The top did not roll down.  You can see the leg line under jeans.  That was the bad thing.

"I ordered the satin waist clincher, and received the lace one instead.  It does a good job of pulling the waist in to give an hourglass shape, but it doesn't do anything to help control the ""pouch"" I've gotten since giving birth.  Also, the garter belt attachments seem to roll up and look weird, and this garment is not invisible as it claims,  You can clearly see where the clasps fasten under shirts that are even the slightest bit form fitting. Another note, some reviews said this product runs small, but I didn't think so.  I ordered a medium and it fit well, although I needed to have my husband help fasten it at first.  After a few minutes of wearing I noticed it getting a bit looser.  I'll be returning this, and going with another brand.",wrong item,2.0,B000147652

"I am giving it four stars because Rago continues to be excellent quality (I own a number of other Rago pieces) and because this did do exactly as promised. This piece runs smoothly from the bra band to the bum, so no bulges between bra and waist cincher which is excellent. It has removable garter straps, A+ in my book. And it has reinforced horizontal stitching to really nip in your waist without making things like breathing, eating or sitting down totally impossible. Unfortunately I return it because it just didn't work quite right for my shape. I am rather short waisted and I have a natural hourglass already, so my waist/hips have about 14"" difference between them. The combination meant that the back of the cincher didn't quite cover my bum the way their longer girdles do, nor could it be hitched up enough to rise above it the way their garter belts do, so it left me with a bit of a bisected bum.  I do think this is an awesome product, and had it been a little shorter in back it would have been a keeper for me.","Great for Nipping In Your Waist, Didn't Quite Work For My Body",4.0,B000147652

"My waist is about 28"" and I bought a Small. I measured, and the cincher took about 1.5"" off my waist. It was snug and a little uncomfortable at first (it didn't hurt, I just felt very aware that I was wearing it) but after an hour or so I barely noticed it. It was really easy to put on myself thanks to the front clasps. My hips are a little wide, so I love that it fits smoothly around the top of the hips instead of just squeezing tightly at the bottom. The downside is that the clasps are visible under solid-covered fabrics, but since I'm planning on wearing it with a wedding gown with beading on the bodice it shouldn't be an issue for me. I could see a difference in my waist and felt more comfortable in some clothing I'd outgrown in the past few years, and had a much easier time zipping up some things I'd recently bought that had been a tight fit. I'm on the skinny side so the difference probably isn't noticeable to anyone except me in the photos, but since my midsection isn't as firm as it used to be, this was just what I needed.","Little in the middle, but still got much back",5.0,B000147652

No other thong I've purchased since then has even come CLOSE to being as comfortable as these (and usually the word ""thong"" and ""comfortable"" are not typically found together in the same sentence!!). These are really the bees knees in thongs.  NONE other can compare.  They ARE pricey, I agree, but if taken care of (I do NOT put mine in the dryer!), they will last forever.  I just can't wear any other brand of thongs anymore after wearing these.  They have SUCH a nice stretch and give to them, too.  I don't know HOW they fit from a size 2 through a size 14, but I know they do, because I'm now a size 14 (5'7 and 175 lbs).... but prior to being out on a HORRID medication which caused me to gain 55 pounds, I was a size 2 (5'7 and 120 lbs)....so I know they fit from at least a size 2 through a size 14!  I personally love the ""chai"" color. Very neutral and very pretty.  I know that's probably their most popular color.  I also like the slate gray color, too (a medium shade of gray). But, the chai colored thong is absolutely PERFECT to wear in the summertime under ANY white pants or white crops or white leggings or ANYTHING white.  They just disappear.

"I have a long history of dissatisfaction with exercise bras. In my experience every single exercise bra BUT this one does nothing more than smash you.  I have a very full cup and it is not comfortable to be smashed into the bra when you're trying to exercise.

This bra has all the features of a ""regular bra"", adjustable shoulder and back straps and  a full underwire but it is reinforced in key areas to provide maximum support.  The material is very sturdy and absorbent without being stiff or confining.

Some of my workout partners wear two bras to get the support they need, in my experience, this bra gives enough support on it's own.  Also, it lasts a long time.  I currently own three of these bras because I workout 3-4 days a week and this way I can always have a clean one.  Unless something better comes along, I'm a customer for life.","It doesn't smash you, it supports you",5.0,B0001LMS5I

As a precaution, wash by hand separately and let it hang dry, you still have to be careful with the ""drip dry"" in terms of what fabric you use to catch the drip.

This is just right.  The band is comfortable and does not make ""back fat"".  It has three snaps - plenty.  The cups fit true to size.  Also, the detachable straps are only 1/2 inch wide, so if you have a dress with thin straps, you might be able to just attach the straps as needed.

"This is the first time I've purchased a Freya Rio and I'm really happy with it overall. It seems true to size (I'm having to size down after losing some weight though, so I may not be the best judge), and it's comfortable despite being pretty stiff. I really prefer forward-projecting bras and this definitely fits the bill, although perhaps not as much as the Panache Andorra. I know some people think this bra is ugly, but I actually like it a lot since it's about the closest thing you're gonna get to a punk aesthetic in a bra. Super supportive. Really happy with the fully-adjustable straps. The only downside is that it's very, very full-coverage so it's not necessarily good for low-cut or sleeveless tops.

"The under-wire on this bra comes out much farther on either side of the ribs than any other Freya lace bra I've bought (I have 5). Probably a full inch more. The cups are also come down further, expecting a fuller chest possibly, than all other Freya lace bras that I have. The middle part of the bra that touches the sternum comes up a good half inch further than other bras as does the actual fabric of the bra itself. This is a bit inconvenient because the bra fabric shows when worn with tank tops, even ones that are not too low. I have had to fold in the fabric so it doesn't show and cut off the little fake-metal piece in the front because that can be seen through shirts. It is also a bit loose near the top if you aren't extremely full-chested, a bit more than normal with Freya lace bras. I normally have to take in the top alittle, but this one was a bit much. This bra is definitely not as nice as I had hoped it would be, but it is better than paying $70 for another one.
For those of you wondering, the bra is 100% see through mesh that reminds me of a swim suit. This is what I expected so I'm fine with that. It's cute. I am a 30G if you are wondering the size.",Underwire much bigger than normal with extremely full cup,3.0,B00021UTA8

"I ordered many bustiers in an effort to find ""the one"" to wear under my bridal gown. I was afraid Amazon Prime would drop me as a customer from all the returns I was making (of course they wouldn't). Of the fifteen or so bustiers I tried on, this one was among the best. I've found that Va Bien is generally the highest-quality brand of all the bustiers I've tried. I ultimately decided against it in favor of a different Va Bien bustier that fit very similarly but was more lightweight--the satin was a bit heavy as a material and I'm a July bride. But I think this would be a solid choice for a winter bride who wouldn't mind the extra insulation. The fit was mostly true to size...I ordered my usual 32DD and it was a supportive and flattering fit. Not much padding, but it still seems to do a good job shaping and enhancing. I did have to put all the hooks on the tightest setting, so you could try sizing the band down a size if you want the bustier to do more shaping work.","Excellent quality, great for a winter bride",5.0,B0002B6PHY

I sized up since most of these products are not the same size.  I typically wear a 38DDD or sometimes 36G depending on fit, and ordered a 40DD to compensate.
The cup sizes almost fit and I could have worked with that; they were just a little small.  The band however wouldn't even clasp... There is no way it was actually a 40 band size; it fit more like a 34.  I would not suggest buying this if you are bigger than average.

This bra stays up no matter what you do, and never have to worry that it will ride down, as long as you get the proper size of course.

"Finding a good wire free bra that offers support is a huge challenge as you know.  This is mostly comfortable and supportive, but I do have to be careful so there is no spillage.  The other problem that while there is no under wire there IS wire on either side of the cups under the armpits and it digs into my skin.  If not for these two issues it would be perfect.  It is a little deceiving to call this a wire free bra but have wire on the sides, while it does lend to support it detracts from the comfort.

bra - obviously we gals who like wire-free want comfort!  Easy to take out with just a snip of the scissors below it

"Okay. So I ordered three packages of Jockey's Elance French Cut Underwear, just as I did last Christmas. I received my underwear and opened it and found what can only be described as GIRL's sized underwear! In fact, last year's size six is two inches SMALLER than this year's. What the beans? I called Jockey and was told to order one size up. Huh? I've lost 22 pounds since I last purchased this underwear. One would think I'd need to order a smaller size. Nope. I wear a 6. Jockey swears a 7 will be the same as last year's 6.  We'll see...

CONS
1) Way smaller than previous year's cut. We're talking two inches smaller
2) If you wear a size 6, and it's perfect, order AT LEAST a size seven.
3) If you wear a size 7 -- a very common size -- order an 8, which, by the way, is often more expensive. Not cool.

PROS:
Customer Service is nice at Jockey.  They're used to hearing that their women's underwear is now WAY SMALL.  They say that the brand insists the sizing is the same; but they know better.

Jockey used to be an awesome brand. Its sizing remained constant for about twenty years.  Jockey used to be what women who are a healthy weight purchased, because it was sized properly.  Hopefully, Jockey's designer's will read this review and realize that forcing women to order at least a size up is not the way to get repeat business.",WAY smaller than last year's Elance French Cut Underwear,1.0,B0002LINM4

(This was the case last week when I compared prices on the two sites.  Even using a 20% off and free shipping direct mail coupon, Amazon's Prime was still a better price.)

"These are beautiful thigh highs, and ""Little Color"" is perfect for looking a little tan but not too much.  However, they run small.  I'm 5'4"" and 120 lbs (size 4-6 or small in clothing), but ordered the C/D size (which is meant for people heavier than me or taller than me) in order to accommodate wearing these a little higher up than normal thigh highs (to avoid bumps and to be able to wear them with short dresses without the lace showing).  Even though I ordered a size up (size C/D, which is one size bigger than the size chart recommended for me), they were still a little too tight on my thigh and didn't go up as high as I wanted (they just fit at normal mid-thigh height but were a little tight on the thigh band).  Had I ordered size A/B (which is what the size chart recommends for my height and weight), they would have been too small and probably would come only slightly above my knee.  So, I suggest ordering at least a size up from what the size chart recommends if you want to be comfortable and not have them be too short.","Great thigh highs, but they run small",4.0,B0002LICNO

"When I first received my shipment, I thought, ""Bikini cut? More like Grandma cut."" Turns out, no need to be dismayed. The underpants are much less voluminous than they appear in the package. This product satisfies both of my underwear requirements:
1. They sell a size that fits me.
If you have ever spent a day wearing the wrong size of panties, you know they will ruin your life. If they are too big they are like wearing a diaper. Everyone laughs at the folds of fabric in your pants. Too small, they wedge into the darkness. A constant annoyance.
2. They are 100% cotton.
I don't know if you have had the same problem as me, but I find most underpants are made out of a combination of polyester and knitted yeast infections.

"I used to wear the Jockey for Her cotton briefs.  They fit perfectly and lasted for years.  Several years ago we moved quite far from a Jockey store and I had to try other brands, none of which were close to the quality and fit of the old Jockey for Her briefs.  I was happy to find Jockey underwear on Amazon but since the picture, the name and the description were obviously different from the original briefs I used to wear I ordered only one package of 3 pairs of the Elance briefs.

Boy, am I glad I only ordered one package!  I am terribly disappointed that they do not fit comfortably at all.  When I got them out of the package the leg holes looked like they were too large and I think that is the problem. They are definitely not ""full coverage"" and I do not want part of my bum uncovered. At least the cotton knit is nice and soft.

Now I will have to try to find another package of the Lollipop brand cotton briefs I bought a year or so ago.  They fit perfectly - just like the Jockey brand used to do.  I will say that the Elance pants are not the worst underpants I have.  I bought a package of Hanes a while ago and they are much worse!

After receiving these underpants I did further research and found that what is described as ""PLUS size Classic briefs"" actually are available in the size 6 that I wear.......and that is not a ""PLUS"" size by any means.  If the description had not specified PLUS size I would have looked at those and ordered them and perhaps been more satisfied.  However, I am very hesitant to order any more Jockey underpants because of the problem with the leg openings being too large in the Elance style.",Very disappointed,3.0,B0002M101Y

"These were sealed in plastic and obviously brand new, so I was rather surprised that the fabric had a strong perfume scent.  After a wash and dry cycle, the scent persists.  It seems the manufacturer has determined that a deodorant was in order...?  Strange, given that we also got Jockey briefs for men another time and they were definitely not scented.  So wow.  Way to turn off fragrance-allergic customers.  I'm kind of surprised nobody else has mentioned the perfumy smell in the reviews, so maybe this was a new thing or one-off.  Possibly I could be convinced that a permanent scent could be miraculously imparted to the cloth through the plastic by accident.  Maybe.  But I'm not going to take the chance.  I'll stick with other  choices.

Update: Turns out there is at least one other review that warns of the scent.  I should have looked at all of them before buying! It truly didn't occur to me that they might be bathed in fragrance at the point of manufacture.

Update: 4/25/2014 - Just to update things, I've washed this underwear 5 or 6 times since I got it, and the scent is still strong.  It's just not fading.  They were so pretty and nicely constructed, I kept them, hoping the fragrance would go away, but now I see that wasn't a very bright idea.  I haven't been able to wear them after the first time and they are making the container they are stored in reek.

"I have purchased this same item for years.  They are still my top choice although their standards are slipping slightly.  On the pro side: They are as described - and it is difficult to find well-made briefs with the elastic covered.  The fabric holds up to lots of wear and laundering.  I find them very comfortable.  My only complaint is that in my last shipment, the sizes were off a bit.  One pair was definitely larger than the other two.  Part of that seems to have been that the fabric was slightly different and sizing was closer after laundering.  However, this was a very slight adjustment.  There seems to have been a problem with the quality control and I'm hoping it isn't a trend.

"These jeans are no more nor less comfortable than other stretchy, skinny jeans. You've seen the ad with the woman doing yoga wearing them? I suppose one could, but I would rather wear something softer and better fitted. I usually wear a size 4 jeans. I am a size 4 according to the Lee size chart. The 4 were too small for me. I do have a bit of a generous booty, but one of the reasons I like stretch jeans is because they usually accommodate that well. I returned the 4 and tried the 6. They were only okay. After all the hype, I was hoping I'd put them on and sigh, YES! But, alas, my reaction was more like, eh... I'll be returning the size 6 too. One feature I especially do not like about these is that since they're leggings and not proper jeans, you can get some unattractive bunching in the crotch area (you can see this on the model in the picture, actually). A benefit of the leggings, though, is that the waist is smooth and so you don't have the button flap interfering if you wear a fitted shirt over your jeans.

Overall, Pros: I love the pull-up design (never have to worry about your zipper slipping down), super-soft interior fabric, very comfortable, and they have pockets.  Overall Cons: extreme variation in fabric results in extreme variation in fit between colors.

Color-Specific Ratings:
- Luxe Gray - 5 stars (I purchased this pair first).  The fabric is perfect thickness and soft, they fit like a glove. My favorite ""jeans""!
- Syrah Velvet - 2 stars. Disappointing. Too loose in the legs.  I was expecting a wine color and looking forward to wearing these for the holidays.  These are a brownish-purple color.  The velvet material is nice, minus the cons I mentioned.
- Electric - 3 stars. Color is fine; although I wish there was more ""wash"" color variation; Too loose in the legs. Material is too thick and stiff for these to fit well.
- Black - 3 stars.  Color is fine.  Too loose in the legs. Material is too thick and stiff for these to fit well. Hoping after a few washes they will soften.

About Me: I'm curvy, larger in the rear, defined waistline, and thinner legs.  I prefer mid-rise pants where there is extra room in the rear, with a tapered waistline, and the thinner and tighter in the legs the better.",Extreme Variation between Colors: Read Review for specifics listed by color,5.0,B0002MCQZS

We got this white sweatshirt at Amazon because we could not find a plain white sweatshirt locally.

"I have a 6.5 yo, skinny and tall kid.  I ordered a Small and a Medium.

The Small one is just right length wise (suspected, thats why I ordered a Medium as a backup so he could wear it next year as well) but huge in the shoulders!  A picture showing that the shoulders in the Small are exactly the same width as in the Medium is attached.  Another picture is showing the proportions of the waist to the shoulder.  If my 6yo was a body builder than maybe.  The sleeves themselves are fine length wise, although pretty wide and bulky, but the ginormous shoulders make them way too long.  So the Small is going back.

Now, the Medium.  This one is a good 2 inches longer, which is expected and fine for us.  The shoulders are still too wide but hey, its meant for a kid 1-2 years older than mine (and therefore larger) so thats expected as well.  The waist is still super skinny.  But the sleeves?  Now those are another 2 longer EACH than already super long ones in the Small one. I don't have a 10 yo so I cant tell for sure, but I don't think humans grow arms that long.  Sadly, this one is also going back.

The fabric is fairly soft.  I guess I would prefer to have higher ratio of cotton to poly, perhaps 80-20, but the 50-50 would do if not for the super strange fit.

All in all, those are good sweatshirts for the money, as long as your kid has a body of a professional body builder with tentacle-like arms.",Weird fit,2.0,B0002NYPC4

"I ordered these tights for an upcoming wedding. My dress is a shimmery silver, and thought it would be fun to have hose that match.

I chose this particular brand because of all the wonderful reviews I read, and the price was nice.

I am not disappointed!  The shimmer is so nice, and will complement my dress beautifully!  When I tried them on, I immediately wished I'd ordered more, because they are very comfortable, yet, seem bullet proof! I don't know how I ever went this long not knowing about these!

They make my legs appear firmer, sexier, and cover any veins that would normally show through regular panty hose.

The band is very comfortable, and doesn't roll or slide down like pantyhose do, yet, they hold me in better than any control top brands I've worn in the past. I actually look like I'm 10 pounds lighter!  YEAY!

"I have worn these hose for years.  Obviously they are made for dancers, but I have worn them to cover up scars and varicose and broken veins.  Also they are head and shoulders above regular pantyhose and other brands of gloss tights that I have tried because the elastic in them is soft and flexible, and I believe this makes them last a very long time.  Other brands of gloss tights don't have the same give, and they run and tear much faster, not to mention that they cost just as much or more than the Danskin brand.  I ordered them because I am frustrated with trying to buy them in local dance supply stores.  They always have some other brand which they defend like tigers.  The only reason I can think of for this is the other companies must give them a bigger piece of the profit pie.  An added bonus:  Men think they are sexy.",A Superior Product,5.0,B0002PNJWE

"These were the proper color and they fit my legs in a flattering way.  They're also very stretchy to allow for maximum range of motion.  The down side is that ballet pink one has an elastic band that wants to cut off your circulation between your upper body and lower body.  If you leave it on, even if you are super skinny, it will probably show the dent from the band.  My solution was to very carefully cut off the elastic band and very, very carefully put a lighter up along the edge that had been attached to the elastic to prevent running.

The ribbing on the sides of the shirt looks nice in person and adds a somewhat more unique flair to a basic closet staple.  The buttons are fine and not loose at all, but my shirt did come with an extra button just in case.

Follow the washing instructions exactly!  This shirt will bleed color onto your other clothing items, so don't let it get wet around white/light colored items.

My biggest complaint with this shirt is that the listing, when I purchased it, did not specify that the sleeve length when fully extended was only 3/4th sleeves.  So at their longest, they come just past my elbows (I have long arms), and when rolled up, it is a short sleeve shirt.  It would have been nice to know this before purchasing the shirt.  But it's still such a bargain that I did not return it.  It still looks nice, but if you want a full length sleeve chambray shirt, search elsewhere!!",Great closet staple,4.0,B0002PQDKE

My stomach isn't large, but I did just have a baby so it's not as tight as usual. This may not be an issue for other people, but I did cut a couple slits in the waist band which made it much more comfortable.

I wore these tights for one day and they didn't get any runs, which is amazing. They're so comfortable and I wore them with a short sweater dress. Unfortunately my wedding ring edge snagged a little hole in the top of them. I'm not sure if it will expand, but I'm guessing it will over time. I'm going to try to seal it with clear nail polish.

"I just received these tights, and honestly have only had the chance to try them on thus far, so this is more of a preliminary review.  These tights, in the Theatrical Pink, Size C, were on a deep discount for only about $3.80.  I needed some pink convertible tights, and also needed a few more dollars on my Amazon order for free shipping, so I bought three pairs of these.  (By the way, boo to Amazon for increasing the free shipping minimum from $35 to $49, but that's another rant for another day.)  The boxes looked a bit worn, and one looked like it had been folded in half.  I opened up the latter box, and tried on the the tights.

According to the sizing chart, I'm on the lower end of Size C, so that's what I ordered.  They fit great!  I'm 5'5"" and probably weigh 145 lbs. by now (I've gained a bit of weight!), and I have short legs but large thighs.  My waist has become a bit pudgy, but the waistband is very comfortable and stays in place when bending at the waist.  The tights are very soft, and are a beautiful shade of pink.  For anyone who is wondering what the difference is between ""Theatrical Pink"" and ""Ballet Pink"", I actually consider Theatrical Pink to be the more typical pink for ballet tights, a pale pink shade, whereas Ballet Pink is more of a peachy pink.  Some reviews have described it as looking orange, but it is not; it is just a warmer pink.  (I do not own any Danskin tights in Ballet Pink, but have seen them in person.)

At first, I was having trouble getting the backseam straight all the way up my legs, but then realized it was because I had put them on backwards.  Silly me!  (The seam was fine on my lower legs but shifted to the sides, then the front, on my upper legs.)  When I finally put them on right, they looked quite nice!  Although there is reinforced stitching on the feet where the opening is, be careful when pulling the foot of the tights up, or else you might rip them.

One thing I must note is that I noticed as I was about to put the tights to wash, the waistband looked like some of the stitching had come undone, and there was a small run in the waistband area.  I really don't think all this happened for the one time I tried them on in my room at home.  When I had opened up the package of tights, it did not look like it had been repackaged, but apparently they had been used.  I'm sure that this is why they were on such a deep discount.  I do not mind, since you cannot at all tell unless you look very closely, and the defects would not be at all visible when worn with a leotard.  However, if I had paid full price for the tights, I would have been a little disappointed.  I haven't inspected the other two pairs of tights to see if they have any defects.  I am still giving them 5 stars because they otherwise seem like a great quality pair of tights, but will update my review later if I find otherwise.  Now that I know how these tights look and feel, I would absolutely buy Danskin tights at full price in the future!

UPDATE 3/18/16: I bought a pair of the Microfiber Footed Tights directly from Danskin, and I love them!  Now I have two pairs of Danskin tights in two lovely shades of pink. ^_^","Lovely pair of tights, but be aware of minor defects with a deeply discounted pair",5.0,B0002QVHK4

"I love Danskin ultrasoft tights, because they are, as the name tells, ultra soft. I am 5 feet 7, 115 lbs and bought a C/D, and they are very comfortable. The waistline is a little too high, especially if you want to wear these tights with open back leotards. The back seam is very pretty, and unlike other tights very straight / does not ripple. I'm not really excited about the colors (I've tried theatrical pink, and also ballet pink). They are just a little too pink for my taste. I was surprised to see the tights had small runs after having used them once in ballet class, at the seam of the ""transition"" under the foot. I've used other brands of tights for months without getting any runs.","very comfortable, but: small runs at first wear in foot area",3.0,B0002QVHK4

In the past, I have found Capezio's light suntan colored capri tights too red for my Chinese skintone (which has a yellow tint).  The color is more similar to Body Wrapper's light toast color.  This is the second pair of nude fishnets I have bought from Capezio.  The only reason I gave the review four stars instead of five is that I wore this new pair of tights for the first time to a ballroom competition and they ripped by the toes after someone accidently tripped me on the floor.  It would have been nice if the tights had survived the crash, but I am not surprised.  However, overall, the tights are very tough.

"I LOVED these tights. From reading reviews I knew to order a larger size--I'm 5'7'' 140lbs and ordered the large. The color I first ordered wasn't my favorite--light suntan-- but suntan should be just fine. I bought these to help cover the tattoo on my foot for work and these worked the best of all the tights I tried. It's a pretty dark tattoo, and no one had any idea I had it. Very sturdy too, lasted a long time.",I LOVED these tights,5.0,B0002QVH9U
"It took me four months to destroy these tights, which is an outright miracle. Usually a pair of tights lasts a day at best for this gal. They are perfect. Fit as expected, good support, good amount of opacity, and DURABLE. Thank the heavens, because I was getting tired of making weekly pantyhose store runs. Gladly ordering a new pair to replace the ones I just (finally) mangled.

Unlike other reviewers, I really like the elastic of the waist band.  It is a thick band of elastic, unlike most panty hose, but it does not roll down at all.  The band does cinch the waist a bit, but I like this, as it helps give the illusion that I have a tiny waist :)

As far as sizing, I am 5'9"" ~145 and the S/M fit like a charm.  This is my usual size.

My only ""complaint"" about these is that they do kind of ball up - like how a bathing suit does when you sit on concrete - after about 3 months. But this could just be due to how I wash them.",Tights vs My inability to have nice things. Tights win.,5.0,B0002QVH9U

I bought them to go along with a Halloween costume because I needed a white tight that would not be too sheer and these worked perfectly.

"At 5'5'' 120 lbs I fit the the sizing guide as posted on Amazon. The sizing chart on the tights but my just into the range of medium, but I didn't see that until they were delivered.  I initially bought them in small because I generally wear a size 4, sometimes 2 and my waist is 25 to 26 inches. The waist on the size small was TINY. To put them on the fabric stretched enough to make them less opaque than I wanted. I exchanged for a medium and the waist is still uncomfortably tight, the rest of the fit was better.
I am most happy with the fact they are the same color all the way up. It can be difficult to find tights without darker reinforcement around the thighs or crotch. Happy to have tights that work with a leotard.

"This top works as it is designed to.  I wish Bestop would come up with a better way to secure the top along the two back edges than the current straps.  They do the job but the way you have to attach them, causes the material to bunch up a bit.  But hey, for less than 60 bucks, buyers can't be too picky.  It does appropriately keep the sun off the driver and passenger and better yet, the Bestop Trail Cover still fits over the Jeep with the bikini top on, and that is a real positive.",Bikini Top for Jeep Wrangler,4.0,B0002SA40Q

"I have purchased the full line of Bestop products (bikini, safari, full top, windjammer, duster, spare tire covers -- all in Almond and Spice colors) over the past two decades, and all were of great workmanship, materials, and quality. I recently purchased a Safari Bikini in the color spice for my '95 YJ, this after my originally purchased bikini was stolen. Immediately, I noticed the tag -- ""Made in China"". All their components used to be made in USA. The second issue I noticed were the cinch straps were of a looser and less quality poly material. Third, as I installed the bikini the Velcro straps to wrap around the rollbar were not stitched into the top in the correct place. It was sewn right in alignment with the sound bar on my Jeep. The original didn't have this flaw. Lastly, the center cinch straps were too short and the back corner straps were too long. All four of the cut-ends of the cinch straps frayed in the wind after only 30 miles of driving.

Ya know ... I'd pay an the extra $$$ to get an American made product with the quality of days of old from Bestop ... I sent the defective top back on my dime via UPS -- $18.00 for their junk. Thanks for nothing Bestop!

"As a child I used to turn socks inside out because I hated the seams.  I also frequently had problems with material bunching near the toes.  I'd repeatedly tug the sock foot up.  This stretched out the sock, exacerbating the problem.

I discovered these socks a number of years ago and have never looked back.  I never adjust them during the day and all the seems are comfortable.

I'd prefer, like most of the other reviewers, that the top edge wasn't rolled as it causes the cuff to migrate and generally looks unfinished.  However, I wear the socks with the cuff turned down. The cuff isn't designed to do that and doesn't look super suave, but as they are hidden under my pants, I don't care.

In addition to being super comfortable these socks last a long time.  I usually buy 6 pairs and they last at least a year.  Even when I replace them they don't usually have holes despite the fact that the toes and heels look thin.  Usually I replace them because they look warn out and the elastic no longer holds its shape.

"I never write Amazon reviews, but these tights disappointed me so much I had to warn potential buyers! I bought these same tights in 2015 and LOVED them, but put hole in the original pair on New Year's Eve with my trendy, almond-shaped nails. I read the recent Amazon reviews of these before purchasing, most of which said that the quality of HUE tights had gone down. I thought, ""How bad can they be?"" and ordered the
Opaque Control Top Tights in black anyway. I wish I had listened to the reviewers. The old tights were thick, soft, and dark--easily the best tights I'd ever had. The new ones are just plain ol' tights. You might as well go to Target buy an equally thin and cheap pair, only you'll spend $5 instead of $13.

If you *still* want to buy these, be advised that they do run VERY small. I am 5'3"", 130 lbs and I originally ordered the HUE Opaque Sheer to Waist Opaque Tights in a 2 (even though per the size chart, 1 or 2 should fit). They were SO TIGHT! I ordered a 3 in the control top (for 165-200 lbs), and they fit but are still a little bit tighter than I would like.

I recognize that this is wholly a First World Problem, but I am pretty darn bummed that I am unable to purchase the same wonderful tights that I maimed on NYE...what happened to you, HUE?",Don't waste the extra $$,2.0,B0002THY0S
I bought these to wear while delivering a fairly active business workshop. I made sure to buy the right size for my weight and height.

I wasn't sure of sizing so I purchased a size up and they fit horrible in the waist and hips. Im not even sure these are worth the trouble of returning.

"With low rise (or butt crack of dawn) jeans so popular, this type of thong has almost gone the way of the dinosaur. They are very hard to find.  So, I was extremely pleased to see them here on Amazon.  I prefer the higher waist style, they just fit more comfortably up over the hip, and lay smoothly.  They don't roll down as I've had some thongs do.

My philosophy has always been:  If da undies ain't comfy, inta da garbage they go!!  I hate to admit how many new thongs I've thrown out over the years because they were uncomfortable. When I found a thong brand that worked well for me, I stuck with it.  Little by little over the years, my options kept dwindling until I found the Elita brand.

I love this brand.  It's the best I've come across and I will definately be purchasing more, just on the off chance they ever discontinue them.  I'll be the little old lady hoarder with the stockpile of them, but at least I'll be comfy during my golden years!  :)

"Let me make one thing clear at the outset: I. HATED. ALL. THONG. PANTIES.  With a passion.  Over the years, I experimented with all kinds of thong underwear, attempting to find one that didn't make me feel like I was walking around all day with a constant ""wedgie.""  I tried every type of thong in existence, from classic cut, to Brazilian, tanga, and G-string; in every type of fabric, e.g., cotton, tactel, satin, mesh, lace, and polyamide.  To no avail.

Enter Hanky Panky.  At first, I balked at paying $20 for a single panty, especially since I wouldn't be able to return it if it didn't fit or was uncomfortable.  But after striking out with some cheaper brands, and some not-so-cheap brands (e.g.,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/On-Gossamer-Women-s-Mesh-Hip-G-Thong-Panty/dp/B002AQSNX8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">On Gossamer Women's Mesh Hip G Thong Panty</a>), I caved and purchased a couple pairs of these Hanky Panky thong panties in black, Plus-Size.  (I had to purchase them from a 3rd-party seller because Amazon doesn't offer the plus-sized Hanky Panky, which fits sizes 14-24).

These panties turned out to be the best $40 I ever spent!  For about an hour after I first put them on, I was on ""high alert,"" looking out for that familiar ""wedgie"" feeling to kick in, but it never did.  I ended up wearing these panties for the entire day (which included quite a bit of walking), and they were still as comfortable at 9 p.m. as they'd been at 9 a.m.  At heart, I'm still a bikini-hipster type of woman, but these Hanky Panky panties have come very close to making a thong convert out of me!  They will definitely be my go-to underwear of choice when I'm wearing certain types of clothes and need to avoid the dreaded VPL.  I adored them so much that I've already purchased a couple more pairs.

Hanky Panky definitely lives up to its catch-phrase: ""World's Most Comfortable Thong.""

"I am a fit specialist and very familiar with this bra.

Here's the inside scoop on this style 9955 Dream Tisha by Le Mystere. Since originally, the band fit so tight in this style. The company recently updated the fit of the band,, so what I mean is,,, the band on the newer version,,, now fits true to size. Ok,,, here's the catch,, some stores still have both,,, the original version (has black fabric label on inside band, which runs tight,, go up in band.)

Then the newer version that fits true to size in band,,,, (newer version has stamped on label on the inside band fabric,,, there is no fabric tag). So this is how you tell these apart,,, black fabric tag on band - go up in band,,,, stamped on label/info with no fabric tag at all - runs true to size. They made a slight variation in the fabric and cups,,, mainly just a bit softer feel and look overall. Hope this clarifies this issue.

Ladies, to get the best fit, be fitted by a fit specialist, especially when you are full fit. Please, don't get hung up on the size, but be very, very concerned about fit; correct fit is every thing. Most of us wear a different size in different style bras. No one and I mean no one, wears a 36D in all bras, never, ever buy a bra you have not tried on. You are wasting your money. It's just like buying a pair of shoes you have not tried on,,, all styles in bras and shoes fit different. Get the best bra you can possibly afford that really fits you well, lifts and supports.

Nothing should be popping out over the top of the cup, if it is go up in cup. Band should be snug to give full lift, but not cutting into you. With bra on, raise your arms straight up. Watch front of band in mirror, if it moves up much, band is too big, if bust falls out the bottom, cup is too small or could be both. Try this with all your bras at home. Get rid of the bras that don't fit, because gravity is now taking over all day long in the wrong fitting bra. That means, your breast tissue is stretching out,,, all day long, when you wear a bra that does not properly support the bust. Why do this to your self,,,, when you don't have to.

A correct fitting bra should hook on the loosest setting (first hooks), so when it stretches you can go tighter. Never purchase a new bra you must hook on the tightest setting. There is no where to go when it stretches. So, this will not lift you any more and your are wasting your money.

Clothing is designed to fit at the natural bustline, halfway between your elbow and shoulder. If your bust is not there, you don't know if your clothing fits properly.

Listen up on this, full fit ladies. If you wear the same couple of bras all the time. Your body oils break down the fibers in the bras, then they are worn out in a few months. But you are still wearing these a year later and sagging down to your elbow. No one should look like that. No part of the bust, should be lying on the stomach.

Purchase 4 - 6 quality bras that really lift and support you at the natural bustline. Let these air out a day or two before you wear the same bra again. Rotate wearing these bras. This gives you a bra wardrobe that all equally support you. Now you throw the bad bras,, that don't support in the trash,, because I don't want you to ever where these again.

I fitted my niece in this bra, she wears a 44F. She sweats easily, so I thought it might be too hot for her. But here's what she said, it's great because it lifts the bust up off the belly, so she does not sweat under there any more. Plus, she said her posture was much better and I could tell this too. She was probably lifted at least 3"" to 4"".

Also, think about this ladies, once you get the bust lifted to the natural bustline. You have more torso, giving you a taller, longer leaner look. Ok now, there are no more excuses for not having a great fitting bra. Believe me your back will thank you.

Here's some questions you should consider:
What allows your clothing to fit correctly?
What takes pressure off your back and shoulders?
What gives you better posture?
What makes a dart on blouse/dress fit in the right place?
What elongates the torso, making you look taller, slimmer, trimmer?
What should you wear when you go shopping for new clothing?

ANSWER: To all of the above,,, a well fitting, supportive bra.",How to get correct fit!,5.0,B00009UW4R

Fine, I already had purchased another one. Same size, but the cups are smaller and the fabric feels different. (I should have pointed out that you NEED to be sized before ordering a Le Mystere bra, I would not have known what size to order otherwise. Le Mystere sizing is different.)

"GET FIT. GET FIT. GET FIT.  Go to Nordstrom's or wherever and get fit.  You cannot guess your Le Mystere Dream Tisha size even if:
 1) You usually/always wear a XX in bras.
 2) You usually/always wear a XX in Le Mystere.
 3) You usually/always wear a XX in Tisha (but not Dream Tisha) bras.

Yes, it's that specific.  Believe me yet?  Good, now read on.

ONCE YOU GET YOUR CORRECT SIZE, the Dream Tisha fits snug, with most of the support in the bandas it should be.  The straps do not dig in and adds some support.  The cups are very lightly padded for modesty and even a bit of support.  There is a firmness throughout the bra that indicates it means business.

My one issue is that the Dream Tisha is not ""lifting"" enough.  I have several Le Mystere Francesca bras, which is a demi cup and provides superior life.  Since it's the same company and this is a full support bra I thought I'd get at least as much lift as the Francesca, if not more.  No.  It's more of a minimizer, pulling inwards towards the body in all directions.  I'm a 32F so small rib cage and huge boobs.  I find this combination to be very difficult to size.  Le Mystere makes excellent bras for women like me.

The nude color is nude only for white people.  I have olive colored skin (think Halle Berry).  This is a pet peeve of mine; companies should honor diversity and provide several nudes for women of color.",Does not lift but otherwise great bra,4.0,B00009UW4R
"I wear a 44G and the formed cup makes it fit well with breasts lifted and staying where they should be. It's lightly padded, just enough so that nipples don't show through the fabric. A little tight in the beginning but only for a  week or so. I have had a bit of a problem with the stays coming through the fabric after they start to wear but I cannot find a bra that fits as well as this one. The only real draw back is that the straps will tend to fall down at times, not always. I've tried the lacy one but the lace in the straps is scratchy near my armpits and it makes it uncomfortable. In the past I could get a savings, such as buy 2, get one free but in the last couple of years I haven't been able to find any savings on any site.",For large breasted women it's the best bra so far.,4.0,B00009UW4R

"So, when people say this is like a corset for your bust, they aren't kidding.  It's like a bra made out of concrete and about that comfortable, not to mention tight as all heck.  I measure a 36 D when I measure exactly per the instructions on their website, and also when professionally measured.  I measured per their website instructions thinking perhaps they do things differently at Le Mystere - nope got the same result.
This is my size, yet the strap is so tight I want to die.  It's like a ratchet tie down for your bra.
Oh - also fun, you may not think you have any back fat, but once you get this strap on, walla - instant fat bulge over the top of that strap that is ratcheted against your rib bones.  This has never, ever, happened with ANY other bra I have owned - not yay!
I don't think I could wear it an hour, much less for a 12-hour shift at work.
I did order the 38 D, thinking maybe a larger strap would make it more comfortable, but no, it still feels like a concrete bra even though it's less tight.

I went to a department store and found a different brand that gives me the same support and is actually really comfortable, and doesn't have tags.
I forgot to mention the LeMystere has tags - UGH - hate tags too.

This is the best fitting bra I've ever brought and it's worth every dollar.

I love Wacoal bras in general.  They really are the best made in the WORLD.  But a note to those top-heavy, full-figured gals, try another style.  I've tried other style bras in my size and it made me feel like a little girl playing dress-up.

I love this style#65115 because I am a B cup and if you are a B cup, this will fit you to a T.  If you want to try a front closure T-back Bra, try style# 65124.

If you want it to last for years and years, wash in the gentle cycle and ""hang-dry"".  There is no reason to put it in the dryer unless you want it to wear out sooner.  Mine are many years old & they look brand new.

Over 20 years ago, I remember being in the bra section of a dept store and I was almost in tears because none of the underwire bras I tried felt comfortable.  I was told that they lifted you up better than the wireless bras I was wearing.  A clerk walked by and asked me if I was doing ok, I told her about my frustrations and asked her what brand she wore and that is how I discovered Wacoal.  I never looked back.

"A lot of how this piece of shapewear is going to fit depends on your butt and the length of your torso.  I have a slightly shorter than average torso, but also a slightly larger than average butt.  So, in the front, the shapewear comes up to my bra, but in the back it hovers only a couple inches above my natural waist, meaning I have a bit of a bulge over the top of the shorts in the back.  If only it was a little bit longer in the torso back there!  Then I'd get the all over slimming effect I was hoping for.  As is, I don't have any muffin top on my thighs and my waist is nicely slimmed.  In addition, it's comfortable, relatively pretty, and has the added bonus of garter hooks for stockings (which I love!).  The slit crotch is also handy.  I find that the back-muffin is reduced if I correct my posture and don't slouch, but I'm not used to having perfect posture all the time, like I did when I was younger.  Ideally, this piece of shapewear would do exactly what I had hoped it would, but as is, it's still a pretty good pice of shapewear and I do recommend it.",Depends a bit on body type.,4.0,B000147990

"SPANX Women's Higher Power Shorts, Soft Nude, Large VS. Rago Women's Hi Waist Long Leg Shaper, Beige, Large (30)

All the wedding dress shopping articles tell you to wear the undergarments you are planning to wear on the day to the fittings, so I ordered shapewear in preparation for my dress fitting appointment. The two main recommendations were SPANX (an obvious choice as this brand has become synonymous with shapewearlike Kleenex and tissue) and Rago. Most of the reviews I read highly recommended Rago so I ordered comparable options in both; high waist and mid thigh.

I wasn't looking for a lot of shaping help. I consider myself very body positive. I love my curves and just wanted to smooth out my silhouette a tad (I mean I am spending a lot of money on pictures and a dress).

The Rago are well constructed and beautiful. They have boning and are made of sturdy elastic lace. They also have clasps for stockings which is very cool. They are very difficult to get on and off and I was very worried about ripping the more delicate areas of the lace (I believe they are much sturdier than they appear though). The lace was itchy but not so bad that I believe you wouldnt get used to it. The boning at the top gives me great confidence that the waist band would not roll down. The tummy panel and the structuring on the sides and back works very well to elevate and compliment your curves.

The SPANX are made of a very comfortable elastic material like very thick nylons. They are very comfortable and easy to pull on. They hold everything in place and smooth out the lines of your body without overly changing your silhouette. The waistband has a think gel strip along the top that prevents the top from curling down (I read many reviews that pointed to SPANX having this problem compared to Rago). I moved around a lot while I tried these on to see if the top would roll down and it did not. The thigh section is thicker than the top and I didn't observe any problems with the ends rolling up either. I believe if you size these correctly you will have no problem with them rolling or sliding out of place.

Both pairs of shapewear feature a split crotch so that they do not need to be removed to go to the restroom (I read a few review where Rago was recommended for having these over SPANX so maybe SPANX has recently added this feature).

For my needs I will be keeping the SPANX. I prefer less shape help but would highly recommend the RAGO to anyone that feels more comfortable with more support! The SPANX also feel more comfortable to me and I have very sensitive skin (I do believe that people with normal skin would find the Rago brand comfortable but I feel that it will drive me crazy).

I think that Rago are a very good deal for the price as they are very well constructed and very attractive.",Rago vs SPANX High Waist Mid-thigh shorts,4.0,B000147990
"I'm undecided about keeping this. Pros are: 1) the hooks for attached hosiery are a great additional bonus. They show as a bump if you wear the shaper under pants, but you can remove the hooks and just the little fabric tags are left inside. 2) Design doesn't cause much muffin-top, as it swoops much lower in the back than the front, so back-fat isn't squished between top of shaper and bra. 3) Lace and overall design is very pretty. 4) Opening for using the toilet included (ESSENTIAL to me in shapewear)! Cons are: 1) Lace material is quite stiff/scratchy. Might improve with washing, but I won't know because I can't wash it if I choose to return. 2) Smallest size doesn't offer as much compression as some other shapers, but this costs more. I am not tiny (5' 3"", 130 lbs., 28"" waist, 38"" hips), but I think an x-small would work better if it were offered. 3) Boning in the front is kind of long if you have a really short torso like I do (ok when standing but digs in when sitting).","OK, but not a clear winner from my perspective",3.0,B000147990

"I bought this shapewear because I've got that post-baby mom belly that I wanted to smooth down in order to wear my usual vintage dresses. I LOVE the way the Rago works to shape and smooth, and keep everything from being a jiggly mess. It's comfortable, and especially in tandem with the longline bra, it's great for vintage lovers and getting a good shape underneath vintage garments. At first, I thought it was near perfect. The legs didn't roll up, I wasn't constantly tugging and pulling to adjust myself, all was good. My only complaint was that, being a woman with a 18"" difference between my waist and hips, the waist was a little loose and tended to fold/wrinkle under waistlines.

But after semi-daily wear (3-4x a week) for a month or two now, the rubberized lines inside the lace around the legs has all but disintegrated, much to my dismay, and the legs now roll up almost immediately. I had high hopes for the wearability, but I can't really wear these if I'm going to sit at all, because of the legs. Hopefully I can repair that.

As well, the lace starts to get a bit stringy here and there, so now when I pull them on my wedding ring gets caught by loose strings.

All in all, if you're going to wear these on occasion, they're great for shaping. But for anyone who wishes to wear them daily or semi-daily, they're not the best option, sadly.",Fantastic BUT... not great for long-term daily wear,5.0,B000147990

"I ordered these in natural.

I am 5'2"" (120 lbs) and these fit in length. If I was very much taller, they might be a little too short or I might have to stretch them too much to get them up.

The hosiery feels thin, but it's sturdy and I haven't had a problem with snags or holes yet.

I am what would be considered a light skinned Hispanic, and the natural color are a little too pale for me. They make my legs look chalky. If you're white or Asian, the color might look natural on you, but I am too dark for it.

I have worn these all day long at times and they don't squeeze me too tight. They are very comfortable except I don't like the toe seams very much. Though the waist doesn't squeeze, it still does some control up top. It smooths you out a little bit.

In case you are on the bigger side, these have a lot of stretch to them.

They fit me right up onto the spot on my belly that it shows on the model.

These are sheer enough that if you have any stubble on your legs or what are commonly called ""strawberry legs,"" they will show through the hosiery.

"Cyber-Warriors is divided into two tapes.  It is all centered on the US military's future high-tech projects and training programs, namely the US Army's.
Cyber-Warriors shows what each weapon and the training is meant to do.
The first tape called the ""Digital Battlefield"" covers future digital programs such as the M1A2, Apache Longbow, Commanche, Land Warrior, micro aerial vehicles, and remote-controlled robots.  While the narration only provides a general overview and brief information, the footage is excellent and exclusive.  You get to see the interior of the M1A2 and the M1A2 in action on the training field, getting dirty and firing its weapons.  The same applies to the other areas.  Perhaps the best footage in my opinion is Land Warrior.  I've seen many photos of the system but never any video until this tape.  Shown are the thermal images (TI) via the TI camera on the rifle and the actual ""windows"" displayed on the helmet eyepiece.
Fictional future scenarios are included, similar to a Tom Clancy book.  The scenarios generally show what weapons are used (tanks and helicopters moving and firing).  It's all very politically correct, citing that superior firepower, technology, and situational awareness will win the day.
The second tape highlights training for the digital war.  Covered are tank simulators and tank computer gaming and terrain-generating computer 3-D maps.  Virtual reality and unmanned aerial vehicles are discussed as are the future gadgets that will be carried by Army scouts.  Also covered are networks and ""black secrets"" such as chips with transmitters in them to secretly send messages.  It's all pretty technical and not discussed in-depth because of its secrecy but makes for some interesting viewing.  Unlike the first tape, the actual gadgets, hardware, and technology are not really studied at all, just shown to the viewer and described what it does.  This second tape is more about software than hardware.  It's interesting to see these games and the new software being developed.
The video footage is excellent and extraordinary and well worth seeing.  The viewer will learn of new programs and developments being created and studied in the US Army.",Excellent Footage About Warfare in the Future,5.0,6305121869

"This summary of Africa's music obviously has to include a huge variety of music from the continent, and it does. It's mostly because African music is not my favorite that the rating is not higher. There are styles to be expected, like Senegalian pop from Youssou N'Dour, Congolese soukous, (which on this album sunds sad rather than happy), and a great track from Nigeria, Abami, which is a fusion of ""Afro-pop, Afro-beat and Afro-jazz,"" and rolls along in an adictive way. But this album also includes a lot of side trips to other African styles you don't usually hear, including Arabic tracks from Morocco and Algeria; Arabesque from Aisha Kandisha's Jarring Effects, and Bellemou, who contributes a catchy song in the Algerian rai style. There's also great Latin-sounding Portuguese music from Cape Verde, a French-language song from Madagascar, and soulful South African reggae (Lucky Dube's Prisoner, with its powerful lyrics). There's also some traditional music, as well as a very westernized jazz track. There's a very beautiful song from Guinea, and a slow, sad song about Aids. Much of this album is really made for dancing. Some of the songs I like very much, and others I don't appreciate as much. Some of the proceeds go to helping Oxfam and its wonderful work worldwide, which is great.",Africa,4.0,B00005NBV6
"It's not bad. I'm new to African music, but I was hoping to find some stuff from Mali, Kenya, Ethiopia or Tanzania here - and there's nothing from there. There's a lot from southern Africa; two tracks from Mozambique, two from South Africa, and stuff from Madagascar, Zimbabwe and the Congo. Interesting tracks from Morocco (electronic Arabesque) and Algeria (Spanish inflected rai).

In general, though, there's a definite pop or modern sound to ALL of the music here. I was hoping to get more traditional African music in what's supposed to be an overview of African music. The unauthentic jazz track from Ibrahim Abdullah (South Africa) really irritated me, and the English language reggae track from Lucky Dube didn't really sound African. Tito Paris track from Cape Verde almost sounded like an excuse to slip Latin music into an African compilation. Though it sounds like cliche, I had hoped to get the feel of the elephants, Maasai, rhinos and national parks that is really Africa.

The enhanced portion of the CD was very enlightening, showing how Oxfam helps in Africa. Perhaps I'm being too harsh to a release whose sale goes to charity. But it was a short CD in length, and they could have replaced the jazz track with some music from Mali.

"I bought this CD before hearing a note of it first.  I rarely do that but I have no regrets in this case. From Cristina Branco's opening plucky tune right through this CD is a masterful trip through Europe, leaving no corner of the continent unturned.  From the Baltic to the Balkans, Ireland to Russia this CD covers it all.  I would love to pick out some highlights to talk about specifically, but each tune is a gem.  Randomly I'll choose a few.  Dilele by Angelite/Fanfare Ciocarlia is an uptempo blend of folk music from two very different Balkan countries.  The blend of Romanian and Bulgarian styles is astoundingly beautiful. Eliza McCarthy's 10,000 miles is an uplifting contemporary folk song from Britain that'll make you hum along after the first couple listens.  Arapiko Louloudi by Eleftheria Arvanitaki will make you feel like you're sitting in a Mediterranian cafe sipping retzina.

The only replacement she could find in stores weren't made from the same elasticised material and didn't fit as well, so I suggested she let me find something on Amazon that might be better - and held my breath as she had never let me buy online for her before.

Two weeks later, my mother was thrilled when her package arrived and found that the bras were made from the elasticised material she prefers with elastic straps (the Berlei ones that she had been shown in store as an alternative are made from non stretch cotton).

The size guide is very accurate and apparently the non underwire cups are comfortable and exactly what she wanted. To make it even better, both bras, together with postage, cost the same as buying one bra here in store.

"This bra was by far my favorite: a pretty design, good fabric, well-fitting and  supportive. I was very disappointed to discover it's been discontinued. If there is any current Vanity Fair bra that looks, feels, and supports as well as this one, what is it?",Why Was This Great Bra Discontinued?,5.0,B00008IF5W
"I purchased this bra years ago locally and loved it.  It was soft, elegant looking and gave good support.  I'd purchased a number of them so I am down to the wire on what I have left to wear so I decided to look online for additional ones.  As luck would have it,the bras is discontinued but some online store had them in stock.  I ordered from several stores only to return the bra because the sizing and fabric had been changed.  What you see in the images is not what the bra looks like and definitely not how the bra feels. First, the bra does not stretch well.  Putting it on reminds me of the girdles that women wore in the 1970's.  I remember my mother pulling on this stiff un-giving object that stretch just enough to slide on.  This is how the bra feels.  I was sent the off-color white that was a flat color, not the soft sheen the original ones had.  I ordered a 34DD and in comparison to other 34DD, this cup was smaller.  The band around the bottom was tight, scratchy and uncomfortable.  I'd just been fitted by a professional who said I wore a 34D, but the DD was way too tight.  I guess bras are going the way of women's fashion. Less fabric & smaller cuts means higher price.  I would not recommend this bra unless your skin is tough as sandpaper.",Not the original design,1.0,B00008IF5W

"I tried my first Vanity Fair bra when I moved to a town next to a Vanity Fair factory.  A neighbor, who worked there, gave me one to try.  I was hooked.  That was in the early 1980's.  Since then, I have tried to be objective and have tried a couple of different brands.

But, I always come right back to my favorite bra Vanity Fair's My Satin Fantasy Underwire.  Being a ""full figured"" woman, it's hard to find a bra that supports effectively no matter how active I am.  It wears and washes well, and still looks silky, pretty and sexy.  This one has it.  I'm at the point in my life I don't even bother trying the newest fad.  This one is perfect.  Always has been, always will be.",There really is no better!!,5.0,B00008IF16
"I am so sad that this bra is so hard to find now.  I am a sturdy 36DD who is fairly active.  This one fits, moves, and can be worn all day with comfort.  It offers wonderful support and gives me a good sillouette. I have been wearing them for decades punctuated by other always inadequate bras when I can find this.  I am really hard to fit.  This bra lifts and separates without going way out to the side interfering with arm movements or cramming the girls together to make a shelf.  The unique crossing front gives freedom of motion, I can reach way up with one arm without having the whole bra shift and get out of wack.

I would prefer, no lines, and a front closure, but there have been no bras that work for me that are that way.  Since the fabric is cut on a bias and has no foam padded preformed cup the bra can shape itself to YOU. No unsightly bulges around the cup!",The only bra that fits and is comfortable,5.0,B00008IF16
"I used to love this bra.  I liked it so much that I sought out my bigger 40-42DDD size online once I had trouble finding it locally in stores.  But, due to a couple of design flaw that would be easy to fix, I've moved on to other bras (with their own shortcomings).

This bra has great no-stretch straps that really work to give lift.  But the straps aren't the padded style so they perform their lift but dig into your shoulders.  Ouch.  The straps are rather wide-set, too, so they're constantly sliding off your shoulders.  I had to go to my local sewing ""notions"" store to buy little straps you pin into your clothing that harness the straps in place so they won't migrate.

The other thing is that the criss-crossing between the cups is the first thing to go.  I wash my delicates in a special, wired bra bag but these crosses just don't hold up for long.  The constant sliding of those crosses against one another is like a saw and they break through eventually.

I wish the manufacturer would fix these things so I could go back to this bra.  I like how the crosses are more likely to lie flat against your breastbone which gives you good separation.  I buy bras now that squeeze everything together but it's preferable to broken crosses and falling-off shoulder straps.  Too bad.",A Good Fitting Bra But it Still Needs a Few Improvements,4.0,B00008IF16
"I've been trying to find a decent bra for ages: one that would be attractive *and* hold things in place at the same time. I was afraid I'd be doomed to the old 1950s bulletproof, cone-shaped bra-in-a-box styles forever...and those are anything but seductive.(I recently changed bra sizes from one that stores carried in multiple styles/selections to a 34DDD, which you have to order online or have made- at astronomical prices.) I was hopeful about this bra, because it was decently priced~~and I wasn't disappointed. The underwire and 4 hooks give excellent hold, the cups are deep enough to cover everything (and keep things pointing up where they belong), and the criss-cross lacing between the cups gives it just enough of the peek-a-boo allure to make it sexy. Even though this bra is a sedate white, it still passed the husband whistle-test. :) Not bad!","Great bra--Sexy, but still holds as well as grandma's bulletproof ones!",4.0,B00008IF16

For about a 1-1/2 years I bought more and more of this style bra - I had them in all 3-colors.  Then one day I was in the store and horror - no more of my favorite bras!

The only good things I can say are unlike some toeless pantyhose I have worn in the past, the toe thong does not bind, and the lightest color actually is light enough for my skin tone, but it is so not worth the itching.  Also, they run rather large, the material doesn't have nearly enough stretch and they bag around the ankles and knees.

Recommended to anyone that wants shape without adding size, though if one is on the smaller side, since it would give good support, it would make one look larger than with an average bra.

"Spongebob Squarepants:BFBB is one of the few licensed games on the GBA that is actually decent. However,there are a few problems weighing down from the greatness it could have been. The story is that Plankton created a robot duplication machine and tries to take over Bikini Bottom,the keyword being 'tries' because he accidentally sets it to disobey (don't ask),the robots are rampant,and our favorite little sponge has to save Bikini Bottom. It may sound cliched,but considering Spongebob's horrible plots as of now,it is pretty good. The gameplay is a typical 2d platformer,you play as Spongebob,as you go through 4 parts of Bikini Bottom fending off the 4 main robot replicas of Sandy,Patrick,Squidward,and Spongebob. During the journey,you will meet up with familiar characters,like Patrick,Mr. Krabs,and one-time char.,Mystery,who is playable in certain sections in the game. The seahorse can eat through certain obstacles,consume enemies,and spit out enemies on switches. While this may sound cool,the controls on Mystery are clunky,as sometimes,when you are so close to a platform and you actually fall off,and because of that, platforming with her is even worse as sometimes ,you need to let go of her in order for platforming,and admittedly pretty solid on Spongebob's part,but the platforming can be tedious because of the bad level design. Also for a licensed game,it does have a lot of replay value,as there are krabby patties in the levels and collecting all of them leads to a bonus level,and it is one of the best parts of the game,as these are fast-paced and fun,as Spongebob rides on a unicycle and collects krabby patties to get a secret item,and these are of the best bonus levels ever,as they have tight controls and great gameplay. The graphics are very good for GBA standards as they resemble the cartoon faithfully,and even have screenshots of episodes prior to the game's release,and considering the limitations of the GBA,that is amazing. The game sounds ok,because while some music sound great,some are very irritating and bothersome,so during the music,I mute it,so overall,the sound is mediocre. Overall,BFBB is a decent game with glaring flaws that pushes down the potential greatness. For a Spongebob fan,I would say rent it,and if you like it,then buy it,but if you're not,then forget about it,and if you want another SB game,then get The console version is appropriate of purchase,The movie game is awesome,and Supersponge is superb.

"I am over 30 years old and I thought I'd try this Spongebob game that my kids had.  I usually try all the games they have.

The game is cute.  I like the graphics and it's bold, vibrant colors.  Spongebob moves pretty good in there.  Slides, walks, jumps, floats & blows bubbles that disable the enemies.

You go through each stage to beat each level.  Once you beat a level, you move onto the next.  There are I think about 4 levels with about 6 rounds in each.  Then there are bosses you have to beat. In each stages, you have to get all 3 spatulas to finish it.  You also need to collect 20 crabby patties but that's optional.  For me, each level takes me about 1/2 hour to finish.

Overall, the game is pretty challenging in some ways.  They have you think of clever strategies of how to get around certain obstacles.  Like for example, there was on stage where I couldn't figure out how to get up there.  Then it dawned on me that I could blow the bubbles on the monster floating above me, this brings the monster down, then push him toward the wall, then jump on him to get over the ledge.  This game gets you thinking of ways to do things.  I like that in a game where it makes you think.

The game itself isn't hard nor easy.  Just perfect.  I also get lost easily as I have no sense of direction.  With this game, there are different ways of getting different places then you need to go back to exit.  (I usually forget where the exit was, after I've bumped into it)

I recommend this game for anyone.  But I'm speaking from an adult perspective as I know there are plenty of adult gamers out there.  Great for kids as well.",Lots of fun packed in this little Spongbob Game!,5.0,B0000AHRPN
I didn't like these because the elastic is way too tight on the legs.  It made the leg openings look like diapers and they cut into my skin and there is definitely a visible panty line. The only good thing about them is the fabric is soft.,Not the greatest underwear,2.0,B0000AKGHM

"Needed some tight running shorts because I don't like how my Nike's bunch up in the inner thigh area. Went to the local sports stores and even Target and Walmart, but the shorts were either too short or too expensive. Amazon saved the day!

These shorts are of good quality. I've had them for over 6 months and they are intact and don't show signs of wear despite me wearing them twice a week. No see through issues and no problems with the elastic band overstretching over time (so far anyway).

But, there are two logos:  one, which is visible in the product photo, is on the top of the left sleeve and is sewn on in such a way that I don't believe it can be removed without damage to the shirt, and the other is an appliqu on the lower, left hemline.",Well-constructed Tshirt for the Price,4.0,B0000DZQCY

(I hope to get to that weight range this year, but doubt I will grow taller!).  I had just glanced at the first size chart that came up, and ordered a 3-4.  I didn't realize what I had done until I forced my body into these.  I believe it is a testament to the hose that they did not tear during this process, and in fact I am wearing them for the second time today.  Quite tight, of course, so I am getting super control!  But I actually did get them over my tummy, and they stayed up all day with no roll-down.  I have the Off black and they are very pretty - in fact  sheer and silky.  I'm going to try the 2/Plus as that is closer to my actual size, and I don't see this style in the larger sizes.

"I was interested in these because of the price. I've been looking for sheer to waist black hose that I can wear with cutoff shorts without a dark panty area showing.

First off, these have an unsightly T-crotch. Secondly, they run small in width and long in length. It took a lot of pulling and adjusting to get them on, when I pulled them all the way up they went up comically high, all the way to my chest. Because they had to stretch so much to fit around my thighs, the T-crotch part stretched below where it's supposed to be and was visible when I tried my shorts on. Not cute. They're supposed to be non-control top but the waistband was still very binding and constricting. It also rolled down. The ankles were too big and not flat against my body, even though the rest of it was too small. The appearance is pretty much the same as L'eggs Sheer Energy, but they ran tighter and longer.

For comparison, I'm 4' 10"", 150lbs, pants size 10/12, and have 42"" hips, and I got size 3/4. If you are tall and have slender hips these might work for you. If you are short and/or a size 10 or larger, skip these.",Short girls need not apply.,2.0,B0000ZFHVW

"These are fantastic! I have only tried them on, not yet worn them out and about. I was so pleased to finally find a brand of thigh highs that are nicely made, with lace that sits ON the thigh, not cuts into the thigh. They also are not skimpy in the height of the lace which is key to thigh highs sitting ON your thigh not cutting into your thigh. I was also pleased to find a brand that has more variety in the sizing since I am not overweight but have very long legs. Most of the cheap brands available in stores in the United States are flimsy and do not fit ON the thighs properly nor do they have sizing for women with long legs.

I used to buy Victoria's Secret thigh highs (the only brand I was ever able to find in the U.S. that had a size that fit long legs) but they have stopped producing them. These look to be even better quality than the VS brand. I am very happy. Because these look to be better quality, I suspect they will have a longer life than the VS brand (each VS pair used to last approximately one year and I am a woman who wears dresses and thigh highs almost every day)!

"Nourhan Sharif, top notch world reknown dancer, and her husband and choreographer, Yousry Sharif, are truly gems in the crown of Middle Eastern dance. Not only are they insanely talented and well-trained, but they have a gift for teaching technique. They teach clearly, building not a choreography but an entire vocabulary of moves that you can then turn into your own performance. If you want real training and authenticity, then this is the video for you.",Top notch technique training!,5.0,B0002HDH10
"This dvd is excellent for teaching foundations of cane dancing or Raqs Assaya. Any Bellydancer interested in learning cane technique will find this useful.

The dvd contains stretches for the wrist, exercises for developing an awareness of your cane, a variety of steps, cane twirling technique, using the cane to frame the body and movements, several combinations, traveling steps, finales and a demonstration/performance by the instructor.  The combinations are shown from a variety of angles so you can see what it looks like from the back as well as front.

The instructor, Nourhan Sharif, provides good instruction for an intermediate level dancer. She teaches in a practice outfit that allows the viewer to clearly see what her legs, hips, midriff and arms are doing. She also demonstrates the moves in a way the communicates the joy, energy and playfulness that originally attracted me to Raqs Assaya. Those who learn well by visual example will appreciate this dvd.

I already knew some saidi cane dancing technique and had performed with a cane before viewing this dvd. However I still learned new moves and more importantly better technique for dancing with and manipulating a cane. I can now twirl the cane with either the right or left hand thanks to the technique in this dvd. (I didn't have the coordination in my left hand previously.) I also found the framing techniques useful for incorporating the can into a dance rather than just using it for a few cute tricks.

Here are a few things I would have liked to have seen in this or a future dvd: A tutorial on appropriate music and the rhythms, a choreogrpahy, a little on the history/cultural background of this style, more presentation/performance suggestions (though some are peppered throughout the dvd), some advice on selecting a cane.

Those are just little wishes, overall the information is useful and well explained. For those who enjoy learning solid technique from their dvds this is excellent. Those who want to learn choreography might be disapointed, however you can use the information to create your own choreography. Also, this dvd refers to the instructors dance technique and uses terminology from her technique without explaining. I am not familiar with her other instruction, but I still found the dvd useful.

Saidi and Assaya dancing can be very aerobic, though this is not a workout dvd. I would encourage dancers to warm up before following the dvd. The dvd does not include a detailed warm up, but it does have excellent streches for the wrist and forearms.

This dvd is probably most appropriate for intermediate to advanced dancers since it references a variety of moves such as 3/4 shimmies without explaining the moves. The cane technique such as holding the cane, cane twirls, etc. could be useful to less experienced dancers who have mastered basic movements and these dancers can grow into some of the more complicated moves and combinations as they learn more dance steps.",A Great Resource,5.0,B0002HDH10
"On last December I performed with cane (Assaya), but with Nourhan's DVD I have learn many movements that I have never seen in Panama before.

Nourhan Sharif presents a very important tool for students and also for teachers, and with this DVD you can practice also basic steps of belly dance. If you practice you can prepare your own choreography....

I hope that the Assaya Choreography DVD, can be in the market soon....ASAP???",Assaya dance,5.0,B0002HDH10
"First things first, dancing with a cane is just fun. It is one of the more affordable props, ranging from $4.00-$25.00 a piece, and it is as much fun to do as it is to watch. You learn to layer the cane over bellydance moves. You will learn to use the cane to frame your body and accent hip work, shimmies, chest moves, figure eights, etc. You are shown stretches for your wrists, to warm them up and prevent injury, and the movements are broken down, so they are easy to follow. I recommend this video for any bellydancer interested in learning cane, or any prop for that matter. It is important to remember that like most moves in bellydance, most of the time it looks easier than it is. If it is a little challenging at first, don't worry. Stick with it and practice, and you can learn it.",Give it a try,5.0,B0002HDH10

$1.95.  However, the next day the mailman brought it back and there were only 3 additional stamps instead of the 5 I  had put on  it.  I called the post office, and fortunately, the postmistress believed I was being honest, and told me to send it back with the mailman.  He wasn't a happy camper, but I did send it back, and I trust that she went ahead and mailed it for me.  I was concerned that it might have been too late for an exchange.

"I am a tall curvy girl with a 33"" waist and 44"" hip with a 35"" inseam.  I ordered a 12 Long, which fits great!  The length hits me right around my ankles, which I think looks great with a skinny jean.  The waist band is very soft and sits nicely about 2-3"" above my hip bones.  I have a larger rear and in order to accommodate my wide hips, the waist band is often too wide.  But with these, I don't have this problem.  And even though they are very stretchy like a legging, what I love is the thickness of the material is just like a regular pair of denim jeans--perfect for hiding those unflattering booty dimples that some of us unfortunately have. :) Highly recommend!",which fits great!

These are amazingly comfy. And I love them. Very tight at first but within 10 min of wearing stretch to correct fit. However the long is really only ankle length. I have been stretching them and almost have them long enough.  They tend to stretch just below the butt and on the side in the same area. I will just have to have them taken in a bit in the spot. If anything order down a size and they will stretch to fit,Very comfortable- fits like a good glove,4.0,B0002MCR16

"Not pleased with the overall fit.  It's droopy no matter how tight I pull the straps and therefore flops in the wind.  The rear straps could've been better.  Our original 30 year old top had to be replaced because of a broken webbing strap, so we bought this one, and I was unpleasantly surprised by the clasps on the straps.  The original had clip buckles which made it easier to adjust and keep tight.  These cheap buckles don't grip the straps and they constantly loosen, not to mention the strap bunches up in the buckle so it makes it even more difficult to pull it tighter.  This cover also requires a curved channel (part 51209-01) whereas the  original did not, so in reality it isn't really designed for the original '85 CJ-7.  If I change the channel to the curved one I would have to change it back to put my soft cover on in the fall because that requires the original (un-curved) channel.  I also don't think the curved channel would fit anyway because there are snaps on the vehicle for the soft top that would get in the way.  Bottom line, I'm sorry I bought it.  I should've just had the broken strap repaired on my original.",Poor design and not a replica of the original,3.0,B0002SA3Z2

"I needed an extended bikini top to give my dog some shade when she rides in the back so I ordered the Bestop 52529-37 Safari Bikini Spice Top for 92-95 Wrangler. Amazon shows that this top is compatible with my 1995 Jeep Wrangler YJ Rio Grande Edition. As I was installing the top I found that two of the straps were blocked by the sound bar that was installed across the roll bar cage. I called Bestop and I was told that this has to be an after market sound bar as no YJ Wrangler came with a sound bar. It didn't feel right but I had no real reason to doubt him. I removed the sound bar and completed the installation. At least the dog has shade. It gets pretty hot here. About a month ago I was walking through a parking lot and saw a Jeep Wrangler YJ with a sound bar that looked like mine. I asked the driver about it, but he wasn't sure if it was stock. Today I did some research and found that, yes, the sound bar is a part of the Rio Grande Edition package. So, Amazon was wrong that this item fits my Wrangler and Bestop is at best misinformed or just shined me on. Nice! On top of that, the rear straps are just 1"" web with a plastic buckle. They constantly slip back up the roll bar and the rear starts flapping. Probably would be ok if I had a padded rolls bar, but that's not standard on my model.

"1995Wrangler Bestop Safari Jeep top.
When it is summer time in Florida the sun can bake you alive, enter the Bestop Safari top. This top covers the front and rear seats providing shade and cover from light rain.

"When I opened the package and saw the suit, I was literally shocked at how shiny and bright it was. I was kind of like, "" uh, no. Sending it back."" So I put it back in the box. Then took it out again a few hours later. Then tried it on. It's a little big, but still snug enough to stay on during long runs, long swims in the pool, and long swims in the lake, even with the wavy water.
What I also like about this suit, aside from the bright and shiny design, is that it's lined with black fabric, so there's no see-through going on.
I don't swim quickly, but the material seems kind of bulky for speed, so if you're looking for an aerodynamically efficient suit, this might not be it.

For the NY's Eve I was invited to a friend's house that I had never visited before and there I noticed the old 2016 Danmala calendar hanging in the kitchen. In another room, the mandalas from previous months were taped to a wall in a beautiful mosaique. Of course, I had to give my friend the new one, and of course, she was super happy about it. It was the first time I've seen it at somebody's home. I bought it only because I follow the mandala lady on Instagram and wanted to support her.
