Timex Group B.V. is one of the best-known American watch companies. Timex's U.S. headquarters are located in Middlebury Connecticut and it has substantial operations in China, the Philippines and India and full scale sales companies in Canada, the UK, France and Mexico.
The company began in 1854 as Waterbury Clock in Connecticut's Naugatuck Valley, known during the nineteenth century as the ""Switzerland of America."" Sister company Waterbury Watch manufactured the first inexpensive mechanical pocket watch in 1880. During World War I, Waterbury began making wristwatches, which had only just become popular, and in 1933 it made history by creating the first Mickey Mouse clock under license from Walt Disney, with Mickey's hands pointing the time.
During World War II, Waterbury renamed itself U.S. Time Company. In 1950 the company introduced a wristwatch called the Timex. Over the next three decades, Timex was sold through a series of advertisements which emphasized its durability by putting the watch through ""torture tests,"" such as falling over the Grand Coulee Dam or being strapped to the propeller of an outboard motor, with the slogan ""It takes a licking and keeps on ticking."" With the help of former Olympic broadcaster, spokesman John Cameron Swayze, sales took off. The company later became Timex Corporation, then Timex Group and, to date, has sold over one billion watches.
The company has remained very competitive and the Timex brand continues its dominance through present day. Its primary market remains the United States and Canada, although the Timex brand is sold worldwide due to its ability to capitalize on its strong brand image and reputation for quality.
One of the most successful and important features available on many Timex watches is the Indiglo backlight system. Indiglo is a brand name of Indiglo Corporation, solely owned by Timex for licensing purposes. Timex electroluminescent lamps, branded Indiglo, were introduced in 1992 in the Ironman watch line. They were an immediate success. The Indiglo lamp uniformly lights the surface of the Timexs watch dials in a manner that makes the dial read very easily in many different light settings. In some newer watches the Indiglo backlight only lights up the numbers, rather than the entire LCD display, which is achieved by means of a specialized film that inverts the LCD transmissivity.
Today, Timex Group products are manufactured in the Far East and in Switzerland often based on technology that continues to be developed in the United States and in Germany. With a large and varied line of watches, Timex has the style for everyone. From the locker room to the board room, there is a great Timex style time-piece for you.

These suggested solutions will evaporate cleanly from metal and glass surfaces. Soap will leave residue behind when dry.
To clean the case and crystal: Moisten a soft cloth with one of the above solutions. Gently wipe the case and crystal clean. Be careful not to put too much stress on the crystal as you clean. *NEVER immerse or soak the case/crystal portion of the watch, regardless of water resistance rating. Moisture could seep past the seals over time.

With the launch of its first watch in November 1974, Casio entered the wristwatch market at a time when the watch industry had just discovered digital technology. As a company with cutting-edge electronic technology developed for pocket calculators, Casio entered this field confident that it could develop timepieces that would lead the market.
Today, Casio is focusing its efforts on solar-powered radio-controlled watches: the built-in solar battery eliminates the nuisance of replacing batteries, atomic timekeeping means the users never have to reset the time. Recently, Casio launched a series of Bluetooth watches that sync to the users cell phone to automatically update the time. Casio is always moving time forward.

With the launch of its first watch in November 1974, Casio entered the wristwatch market at a time when the watch industry had just discovered digital technology. As a company with cutting-edge electronic technology developed for pocket calculators, Casio entered this field confident that it could develop timepieces that would lead the market.
Today, Casio is focusing its efforts on solar-powered radio-controlled watches: the built-in solar battery eliminates the nuisance of replacing batteries, atomic timekeeping means the users never have to reset the time. Recently, Casio launched a series of Bluetooth watches that sync to the users cell phone to automatically update the time. Casio is always moving time forward.

How do I view more information on a news story? On the MSN Direct Web site, click the Channels tab, click News, and then click View Latest News. To view an entire article, click Read Full Article for the article you are interested in. To sort alphabetically by headline, click Headline at the top of the list. To sort by date, click Date. To sort alphabetically by news category, click Category. Note: You may see articles on the MSN Direct Web site that you never saw on your watch. These articles may have cycled through your watch before you had a chance to read them. If you want to increase the number of news articles stored on your watch, go to the News Settings mode of the News channel.
Does my watch automatically adjust for time zones and daylight savings time? Yes. MSN Direct references an atomic clock (an extremely precise timekeeping device that uses atomic measurement for absolute accuracy) as its time standard, and broadcasts this time to your watch over local FM radio waves. Your watch should automatically receive the time and remain accurate, without needing to be set by you. If you travel to another time zone, your watch should update itself automatically with the correct local time, as long as you are within an MSN Direct coverage area.

Today, Nixon watches are still inspired by modern, youthful culture, but the catalog has expanded to include a wide variety of styles beyond skate and surf.

","The Fortis Men's 626.22.32 M Spacematic Eco Gray Stainless Steel Watch is an intrepid timepiece from a brand that has grown up in the pages of aviation history. Featuring a grey analog dial, date display and a grey stainless steel band, this watch boasts a fearless design with unparalleled style.

FORTIS belongs to the traditional Swiss watch brands, which has been active since its foundation in 1912 without interruption. As the world's first manufacturer of automatic wristwatches in 1926, FORTIS went down in watch history by producing the first automatic watch, the legendary Harwood, in a series production. In the middle of the '50s and '60s, to the climax of the automatic wristwatches, FORTIS enjoyed a good reputation as well as a worldwide brand awareness and distribution network.
In the '80s, FORTIS was known as a manufacturer of functional, reliable mechanical wristwatches. In 1994, after endurance tests on the borderline of modern physics, the Star City Training Center chose the FORTIS Official Cosmonauts Chronograph as part of their Official Cosmonauts' equipment. Since then, FORTIS automatic wristwatches have proven their space capability in several missions, even outside of the protective space station in outer space.
Based on the intensive collaboration with the experts in space travel, a unique new watch was developed: The FORTIS Official Cosmonauts Chronograph Automatic Alarm. A real spin-off from space and a world's first, the company came out with the FORTIS chronograph automatic with a mechanical alarm. With the development of this movement, FORTIS has earned a lot of approval from competitors and the professional world.
Exactly 10 years after the first official flight, FORTIS was reconfirmed in 2004 as the official wristwatch supplier of the Russian Space program on board of the ISS still today. FORTIS will also accompany space travelers for the first Mars mission as the official supplier of the Mars 500 mission, which started in June 2010 and will take more than one and half years to complete. Crew members can rely on their FORTIS Automatic watches during this long test trip.
As a longtime partner of space organizations, FORTIS invests in modern technologies and ensures in this way the future of the 100-year old brand in an ever-changing watch market.

Since its founding by its namesake in 1976, Raymond Weil draws inspiration from major musical works to create elegant and cutting-edge timepieces. Named after the Wagner opera, the signature Parsifal collection balances symmetry and harmony with a powerful, valiant outlook befitting of the opera's hero. The Don Giovanni collection, named after Mozart's comedic opera, blends daring design with advanced technical prowess, and the Don Giovanni Cosi Grande mechanical chronograph is hand assembled by Raymond Weil's finest watchmakers. Over the years, Raymond Weil has introduced a number of other series that helped the company become an enigmatic leader of the Swiss watch industry, including the Othello, with its discreet design that emphasizes strength of character and uncompromising beauty, and the sophisticated, color-stained-crystal Traviata.
Based in Geneva, Switzerland, Raymond Weil watches are manufactured entirely in the Swiss watchmaking universe. The company's signature motto--""Independence is a state of mind""--is a reminder of its desire to conceive timepieces that are different, elegant and modern, while at the same time displaying all the rigor of watchmaking excellence.

Raymond Weil, located in the heart of Geneva, Switzerland, is one of the last independent Swiss luxury watch companies. Even more uniquely, the company has remained a family business and is currently managed by Raymond Weil's son-in-law Olivier Bernheim, and his sons, Elie and Pierre Bernheim.
Raymond Weil opened his watch-making business in 1976 during a very difficult period for mechanical watches. At the time, quartz watches were swiftly replacing their predecessors as a more affordable and equally accurate alternative. However, due to his 26 years of experience in the industry, Raymond Weil's design concepts, impeccable, mechanical movements, and commitment to entirely Swiss-made products earned him a clientele that continued to expand over the past 37 years.
Despite the company's current popularity, these high standards have not relaxed, and each Raymond Weil watch passes 350 different checks before being put on the market. Raymond Weil's in-depth knowledge of horology has earned him several prestigious recognitions, including being named President of the Watch Manufacturer's Union of Geneva, Vice President of the Watch Industry's Training Center in Lausanne, member of the Watchmakers' Federation, and President of the Exhibitors' Committee of the World Watch-making and Jewelry Exhibition at Basel.
The company's signature motto--""Independence is a state of mind""--is a reminder of its desire to conceive timepieces that are different, elegant and modern, while at the same time displaying all the rigor of watchmaking excellence.

Timex Group B.V. is one of the best-known American watch companies. Timex's U.S. headquarters are located in Middlebury Connecticut and it has substantial operations in China, the Philippines and India and full scale sales companies in Canada, the UK, France and Mexico.
The company began in 1854 as Waterbury Clock in Connecticut's Naugatuck Valley, known during the nineteenth century as the ""Switzerland of America."" Sister company Waterbury Watch manufactured the first inexpensive mechanical pocket watch in 1880. During World War I, Waterbury began making wristwatches, which had only just become popular, and in 1933 it made history by creating the first Mickey Mouse clock under license from Walt Disney, with Mickey's hands pointing the time.
During World War II, Waterbury renamed itself U.S. Time Company. In 1950 the company introduced a wristwatch called the Timex. Over the next three decades, Timex was sold through a series of advertisements which emphasized its durability by putting the watch through ""torture tests,"" such as falling over the Grand Coulee Dam or being strapped to the propeller of an outboard motor, with the slogan ""It takes a licking and keeps on ticking."" With the help of former Olympic broadcaster, spokesman John Cameron Swayze, sales took off. The company later became Timex Corporation, then Timex Group and, to date, has sold over one billion watches.
The company has remained very competitive and the Timex brand continues its dominance through present day. Its primary market remains the United States and Canada, although the Timex brand is sold worldwide due to its ability to capitalize on its strong brand image and reputation for quality.
One of the most successful and important features available on many Timex watches is the Indiglo backlight system. Indiglo is a brand name of Indiglo Corporation, solely owned by Timex for licensing purposes. Timex electroluminescent lamps, branded Indiglo, were introduced in 1992 in the Ironman watch line. They were an immediate success. The Indiglo lamp uniformly lights the surface of the Timexs watch dials in a manner that makes the dial read very easily in many different light settings. In some newer watches the Indiglo backlight only lights up the numbers, rather than the entire LCD display, which is achieved by means of a specialized film that inverts the LCD transmissivity.
Today, Timex Group products are manufactured in the Far East and in Switzerland often based on technology that continues to be developed in the United States and in Germany. With a large and varied line of watches, Timex has the style for everyone. From the locker room to the board room, there is a great Timex style time-piece for you.

Evocative of a simpler era, and perhaps reminiscent of a fathers or grandfathers timepiece, this classic pocket watch will make a lasting impression. It is also a unique and stylish alternative for men who do not like the feel of a wristwatch. The flat, smooth timepiece is crafted from polished stainless steel and has a square shape with rounded corners. It measures just over two inches in diameter and fits nicely in the palm of the hand. The round watch face has a cream colored border around a silver center that is subtly textured with concentric circles. The watch face features Roman numerals as well as minute markings at five-minute increments. A chronograph at 6 oclock displays the seconds. A lightweight, 17-inch chain, made up of circular links of brushed stainless steel, features lobster-claw clasps that allow the wearer to fasten the watch securely.
Other features include:  Japan quartz movement Three-hand display Nickel-free, hypoallergenic 316L stainless steel
Stainless steel is a very durable metal alloy that is virtually immune to rust, discoloration, and corrosion.
Water Resistance
This watch is water resistant to 30 meters. Before using the watch in or near water, be sure that the crown is pushed in completely. If the watch is underwater or wet, do not use pushers, rotating bezels, or crowns. Once it has become wet, wipe it dry as soon as possible; if it comes in contact with salt water, rinse cases and bracelets immediately and thoroughly with fresh water.
Battery
The battery in this Kenneth Cole watch should last approximately two years. When the battery expires, replace it as soon as possible to prevent any malfunction. For battery replacement, Kenneth Cole recommends that you contact an authorized Kenneth Cole dealership. This watch uses the 377/319 battery type.

Timex Group B.V. is one of the best-known American watch companies. Timex's U.S. headquarters are located in Middlebury Connecticut and it has substantial operations in China, the Philippines and India and full scale sales companies in Canada, the UK, France and Mexico.
The company began in 1854 as Waterbury Clock in Connecticut's Naugatuck Valley, known during the nineteenth century as the ""Switzerland of America."" Sister company Waterbury Watch manufactured the first inexpensive mechanical pocket watch in 1880. During World War I, Waterbury began making wristwatches, which had only just become popular, and in 1933 it made history by creating the first Mickey Mouse clock under license from Walt Disney, with Mickey's hands pointing the time.
During World War II, Waterbury renamed itself U.S. Time Company. In 1950 the company introduced a wristwatch called the Timex. Over the next three decades, Timex was sold through a series of advertisements which emphasized its durability by putting the watch through ""torture tests,"" such as falling over the Grand Coulee Dam or being strapped to the propeller of an outboard motor, with the slogan ""It takes a licking and keeps on ticking."" With the help of former Olympic broadcaster, spokesman John Cameron Swayze, sales took off. The company later became Timex Corporation, then Timex Group and, to date, has sold over one billion watches.
The company has remained very competitive and the Timex brand continues its dominance through present day. Its primary market remains the United States and Canada, although the Timex brand is sold worldwide due to its ability to capitalize on its strong brand image and reputation for quality.
One of the most successful and important features available on many Timex watches is the Indiglo backlight system. Indiglo is a brand name of Indiglo Corporation, solely owned by Timex for licensing purposes. Timex electroluminescent lamps, branded Indiglo, were introduced in 1992 in the Ironman watch line. They were an immediate success. The Indiglo lamp uniformly lights the surface of the Timexs watch dials in a manner that makes the dial read very easily in many different light settings. In some newer watches the Indiglo backlight only lights up the numbers, rather than the entire LCD display, which is achieved by means of a specialized film that inverts the LCD transmissivity.
Today, Timex Group products are manufactured in the Far East and in Switzerland often based on technology that continues to be developed in the United States and in Germany. With a large and varied line of watches, Timex has the style for everyone. From the locker room to the board room, there is a great Timex style time-piece for you.

Maintaining Your Skagen Watch
All Skagen watches operate with standard batteries. When necessary, any jeweler can replace them for you. Different models are water resistant to varying degrees. Please refer to the back of your watch for the water resistant rating.
Cleaning Your Skagen Watch Skagen suggests the following solutions for cleaning metal and crystal surfaces:
These suggested solutions will evaporate cleanly from metal and glass surfaces. Soap will leave residue behind when dry.
To clean the case and crystal: Moisten a soft cloth with one of the above solutions. Gently wipe the case and crystal clean. Be careful not to put too much stress on the crystal as you clean. *NEVER immerse or soak the case/crystal portion of the watch, regardless of water resistance rating. Moisture could seep past the seals over time.
To clean the band or strap: Skagen soft mesh bands are easily adjustable. Simply insert a small screwdriver or similar tool into the clasp. Lift up the clasp without applying pressure to the thin pin across the clasp and move to desired position. Snap closed securely. Make sure the clasp is set in one of the indentations on the back of the band. Link bands are completely adjustable anywhere watches are serviced.

Maintaining Your Skagen Watch
All Skagen watches operate with standard batteries. When necessary, any jeweler can replace them for you. Different models are water resistant to varying degrees. Please refer to the back of your watch for the water resistant rating.
Cleaning Your Skagen Watch Skagen suggests the following solutions for cleaning metal and crystal surfaces:
These suggested solutions will evaporate cleanly from metal and glass surfaces. Soap will leave residue behind when dry.
To clean the case and crystal: Moisten a soft cloth with one of the above solutions. Gently wipe the case and crystal clean. Be careful not to put too much stress on the crystal as you clean. *NEVER immerse or soak the case/crystal portion of the watch, regardless of water resistance rating. Moisture could seep past the seals over time.
To clean the band or strap: Skagen soft mesh bands are easily adjustable. Simply insert a small screwdriver or similar tool into the clasp. Lift up the clasp without applying pressure to the thin pin across the clasp and move to desired position. Snap closed securely. Make sure the clasp is set in one of the indentations on the back of the band. Link bands are completely adjustable anywhere watches are serviced.

Casio
With the launch of its first watch in November 1974, Casio entered the wristwatch market at a time when the watch industry had just discovered digital technology. As a company with cutting-edge electronic technology developed for pocket calculators, Casio entered this field confident that it could develop timepieces that would lead the market.
Today, Casio is focusing its efforts on solar-powered radio-controlled watches: the built-in solar battery eliminates the nuisance of replacing batteries, atomic timekeeping means the users never have to reset the time. Recently, Casio launched a series of Bluetooth watches that sync to the users cell phone to automatically update the time. Casio is always moving time forward.

","Kenneth Cole watches are under a limited lifetime warranty. This warranty does not apply to normal wear and tear or abuse, excluded battery, case, crystal, strap, malfunction, and deterioration resulting from accident, negligence and tampering.
Make an impression with this artful, stylish stainless steel bracelet-style watch from the Kenneth Cole New York collection. The tall rectangular watch body (approximately 1.2 inches wide) frames its textured, shimmery dark green face with brushed stainless steel. The muted, brushed stainless steel bracelet band is composed of angled trident shapes and small polished stainless steel accents. It tapers slightly to a .8-inch width. This timepiece will add an elegant accent to either business attire or stylish evening wear.
Other features include:  Japan quartz movement Three-hand display with luminous minute and hour hands Date function at the 6 o'clock position  A very durable metal alloy (usually containing 10-20% chromium), stainless steel is virtually immune to rust, discoloration, and corrosion.
Water Resistance This watch is water resistant to 50 meters. Before using the watch in or near water, be sure that the crown is pushed in completely. If the watch is underwater or wet, do not use pushers, rotating bezels, or crowns. Once it has become wet, wipe it dry as soon as possible; if it comes in contact with salt water, rinse cases and bracelets immediately and thoroughly with fresh water.
Battery The battery in this Kenneth Cole watch should last approximately two years. When the battery expires, replace it as soon as possible to prevent any malfunction. For battery replacement, Kenneth Cole recommends that you contact an authorized Kenneth Cole dealership. This watch uses the SR621SW battery type.

The story of Nixon watches begins in Encinitas, California in 1997, where founders Andy Laats and Chad Dinenna launched a line of timepieces for people who surf, skate, board, and actively engage in the outdoor world. Today, Nixon watches are still inspired by modern, youthful culture, but the catalog has expanded to include a wide variety of styles beyond skate and surf. Their styles include simple monochromatic watches with silicone straps, DJ-inspired digital and LED displays, simple analog watches that draw on horological history, and sleek bracelet watches for a night out in the city. Whatever form they take, Nixon watches are some of the most coveted fashion watches in the market.

","The Fortis Men's 626.22.32 M Spacematic Eco Gray Stainless Steel Watch is an intrepid timepiece from a brand that has grown up in the pages of aviation history. Featuring a grey analog dial, date display and a grey stainless steel band, this watch boasts a fearless design with unparalleled style.

FORTIS belongs to the traditional Swiss watch brands, which has been active since its foundation in 1912 without interruption. As the world's first manufacturer of automatic wristwatches in 1926, FORTIS went down in watch history by producing the first automatic watch, the legendary Harwood, in a series production. In the middle of the '50s and '60s, to the climax of the automatic wristwatches, FORTIS enjoyed a good reputation as well as a worldwide brand awareness and distribution network.
In the '80s, FORTIS was known as a manufacturer of functional, reliable mechanical wristwatches. In 1994, after endurance tests on the borderline of modern physics, the Star City Training Center chose the FORTIS Official Cosmonauts Chronograph as part of their Official Cosmonauts' equipment. Since then, FORTIS automatic wristwatches have proven their space capability in several missions, even outside of the protective space station in outer space.
Based on the intensive collaboration with the experts in space travel, a unique new watch was developed: The FORTIS Official Cosmonauts Chronograph Automatic Alarm.

FORTIS belongs to the traditional Swiss watch brands, which has been active since its foundation in 1912 without interruption. As the world's first manufacturer of automatic wristwatches in 1926, FORTIS went down in watch history by producing the first automatic watch, the legendary Harwood, in a series production. In the middle of the '50s and '60s, to the climax of the automatic wristwatches, FORTIS enjoyed a good reputation as well as a worldwide brand awareness and distribution network.
In the '80s, FORTIS was known as a manufacturer of functional, reliable mechanical wristwatches. In 1994, after endurance tests on the borderline of modern physics, the Star City Training Center chose the FORTIS Official Cosmonauts Chronograph as part of their Official Cosmonauts' equipment. Since then, FORTIS automatic wristwatches have proven their space capability in several missions, even outside of the protective space station in outer space.
Based on the intensive collaboration with the experts in space travel, a unique new watch was developed: The FORTIS Official Cosmonauts Chronograph Automatic Alarm. A real spin-off from space and a world's first, the company came out with the FORTIS chronograph automatic with a mechanical alarm. With the development of this movement, FORTIS has earned a lot of approval from competitors and the professional world.
Exactly 10 years after the first official flight, FORTIS was reconfirmed in 2004 as the official wristwatch supplier of the Russian Space program on board of the ISS still today.

Since its founding by its namesake in 1976, Raymond Weil draws inspiration from major musical works to create elegant and cutting-edge timepieces. Named after the Wagner opera, the signature Parsifal collection balances symmetry and harmony with a powerful, valiant outlook befitting of the opera's hero. The Don Giovanni collection, named after Mozart's comedic opera, blends daring design with advanced technical prowess, and the Don Giovanni Cosi Grande mechanical chronograph is hand assembled by Raymond Weil's finest watchmakers. Over the years, Raymond Weil has introduced a number of other series that helped the company become an enigmatic leader of the Swiss watch industry, including the Othello, with its discreet design that emphasizes strength of character and uncompromising beauty, and the sophisticated, color-stained-crystal Traviata.
Based in Geneva, Switzerland, Raymond Weil watches are manufactured entirely in the Swiss watchmaking universe. The company's signature motto--""Independence is a state of mind""--is a reminder of its desire to conceive timepieces that are different, elegant and modern, while at the same time displaying all the rigor of watchmaking excellence.

Raymond Weil, located in the heart of Geneva, Switzerland, is one of the last independent Swiss luxury watch companies. Even more uniquely, the company has remained a family business and is currently managed by Raymond Weil's son-in-law Olivier Bernheim, and his sons, Elie and Pierre Bernheim.
Raymond Weil opened his watch-making business in 1976 during a very difficult period for mechanical watches. At the time, quartz watches were swiftly replacing their predecessors as a more affordable and equally accurate alternative. However, due to his 26 years of experience in the industry, Raymond Weil's design concepts, impeccable, mechanical movements, and commitment to entirely Swiss-made products earned him a clientele that continued to expand over the past 37 years.
Despite the company's current popularity, these high standards have not relaxed, and each Raymond Weil watch passes 350 different checks before being put on the market. Raymond Weil's in-depth knowledge of horology has earned him several prestigious recognitions, including being named President of the Watch Manufacturer's Union of Geneva, Vice President of the Watch Industry's Training Center in Lausanne, member of the Watchmakers' Federation, and President of the Exhibitors' Committee of the World Watch-making and Jewelry Exhibition at Basel.
The company's signature motto--""Independence is a state of mind""--is a reminder of its desire to conceive timepieces that are different, elegant and modern, while at the same time displaying all the rigor of watchmaking excellence.

","30M Water Resistant / Leather strap / INDIGLO night-light

Timex Group B.V. is one of the best-known American watch companies. Timex's U.S. headquarters are located in Middlebury Connecticut and it has substantial operations in China, the Philippines and India and full scale sales companies in Canada, the UK, France and Mexico.
The company began in 1854 as Waterbury Clock in Connecticut's Naugatuck Valley, known during the nineteenth century as the ""Switzerland of America."" Sister company Waterbury Watch manufactured the first inexpensive mechanical pocket watch in 1880. During World War I, Waterbury began making wristwatches, which had only just become popular, and in 1933 it made history by creating the first Mickey Mouse clock under license from Walt Disney, with Mickey's hands pointing the time.
During World War II, Waterbury renamed itself U.S. Time Company. In 1950 the company introduced a wristwatch called the Timex. Over the next three decades, Timex was sold through a series of advertisements which emphasized its durability by putting the watch through ""torture tests,"" such as falling over the Grand Coulee Dam or being strapped to the propeller of an outboard motor, with the slogan ""It takes a licking and keeps on ticking."" With the help of former Olympic broadcaster, spokesman John Cameron Swayze, sales took off. The company later became Timex Corporation, then Timex Group and, to date, has sold over one billion watches.
The company has remained very competitive and the Timex brand continues its dominance through present day. Its primary market remains the United States and Canada, although the Timex brand is sold worldwide due to its ability to capitalize on its strong brand image and reputation for quality.
One of the most successful and important features available on many Timex watches is the Indiglo backlight system. Indiglo is a brand name of Indiglo Corporation, solely owned by Timex for licensing purposes. Timex electroluminescent lamps, branded Indiglo, were introduced in 1992 in the Ironman watch line. They were an immediate success. The Indiglo lamp uniformly lights the surface of the Timexs watch dials in a manner that makes the dial read very easily in many different light settings. In some newer watches the Indiglo backlight only lights up the numbers, rather than the entire LCD display, which is achieved by means of a specialized film that inverts the LCD transmissivity.
Today, Timex Group products are manufactured in the Far East and in Switzerland often based on technology that continues to be developed in the United States and in Germany. With a large and varied line of watches, Timex has the style for everyone. From the locker room to the board room, there is a great Timex style time-piece for you.

The round watch face has a cream colored border around a silver center that is subtly textured with concentric circles. The watch face features Roman numerals as well as minute markings at five-minute increments. A chronograph at 6 oclock displays the seconds. A lightweight, 17-inch chain, made up of circular links of brushed stainless steel, features lobster-claw clasps that allow the wearer to fasten the watch securely.
Other features include:  Japan quartz movement Three-hand display Nickel-free, hypoallergenic 316L stainless steel
Stainless steel is a very durable metal alloy that is virtually immune to rust, discoloration, and corrosion.
Water Resistance
This watch is water resistant to 30 meters. Before using the watch in or near water, be sure that the crown is pushed in completely. If the watch is underwater or wet, do not use pushers, rotating bezels, or crowns.

The battery in this Kenneth Cole watch should last approximately two years. When the battery expires, replace it as soon as possible to prevent any malfunction. For battery replacement, Kenneth Cole recommends that you contact an authorized Kenneth Cole dealership. This watch uses the 377/319 battery type.

Casio
With the launch of its first watch in November 1974, Casio entered the wristwatch market at a time when the watch industry had just discovered digital technology. As a company with cutting-edge electronic technology developed for pocket calculators, Casio entered this field confident that it could develop timepieces that would lead the market.
Today, Casio is focusing its efforts on solar-powered radio-controlled watches: the built-in solar battery eliminates the nuisance of replacing batteries, atomic timekeeping means the users never have to reset the time. Recently, Casio launched a series of Bluetooth watches that sync to the users cell phone to automatically update the time. Casio is always moving time forward.

This handsome, silver- and black-toned stainless steel kinetic watch is powered by the natural movements of your wrist, so youÂ’ll never need to change a battery.  It has a six-month power reserve capacitor, so that even if you leave it on the shelf for a few months, it will continue to keep time accurately.  A power reserve indicator shows how much reserve power is left.  When the reserve drops to less than 24 hours, the second hand will warn you by shifting to two-second increments.  This particular watch has a black dial with silver-toned hands and markers.  It features a Roman numeral at twelve oÂ’clock and a date window at three oÂ’clock. The dial is set in a stainless steel bezel with a lustrous black satin finish.  This finish is achieved through the use of TiCN plating, a plating process that uses a titanium, carbon and nitride compound to create fabulous finishes in shades of black and gray.  The black satin TiCN finish is repeated in narrow lines that accent the stainless steel bracelet-style band.  The band fastens securely with a push-button release clasp.  Other features include a curved Hardlex crystal and a screw-down caseback.  Water-tested to 100 meters, this watch is suitable for both swimming and snorkeling.
Kinetic: A powerhouse in technological innovationLike mechanical and quartz, Kinetic is a platform. Over the past 20 years, SEIKO has created on this platform a suite of Kinetic movements, each bringing unique features to the consumer.It was at the 1986 Basel Fair that SEIKO unveiled its first Kinetic prototype. Introduced under the trial name of 'AGM', it was the first watch in the world to convert kinetic movement into electrical energy. It was the first step in a development that, 20 years later, has made Kinetic synonymous with environmental friendliness, high performance and long-lasting convenience to a generation of users worldwide. From the launch in 1988 of the first commercially available watch (then under the new name AGS) until today, over eight million Kinetic watches have been sold (as of 2007).In 1998, Kinetic Auto Relay was released, extending the 'at-rest' operating period of the watch to a remarkable 4 years. 1999 saw the launch of the Ultimate Kinetic Chronograph, a masterpiece which fused the very best of SEIKO's mechanical and electronic watch making skills, and in 2003 another Kinetic Chronograph was launched. At Baselworld 2005, the Kinetic Perpetual made its first appearance, combining Kinetic convenience and longevity with a perpetual calendar, correct to the year 2100. In 2007, SEIKO's emotional technology Kinetic Direct Drive is introduced.

With the launch of its first watch in November 1974, Casio entered the wristwatch market at a time when the watch industry had just discovered digital technology. As a company with cutting-edge electronic technology developed for pocket calculators, Casio entered this field confident that it could develop timepieces that would lead the market.
Today, Casio is focusing its efforts on solar-powered radio-controlled watches: the built-in solar battery eliminates the nuisance of replacing batteries, atomic timekeeping means the users never have to reset the time. Recently, Casio launched a series of Bluetooth watches that sync to the users cell phone to automatically update the time. Casio is always moving time forward.

With its unique black and gray asymmetrical curved case, this handsome mens kinetic watch has a modern style to match its modern technology. Powered by human motion, the watch draws its energy from the natural movements of your wrist, meaning youll never need to change a battery. It has a six-month power reserve capacitor, so that even if you leave it on the shelf for six months, it will continue to keep accurate time. A power reserve indicator shows how much reserve power is left. When the reserve drops to less than 24 hours, the second hand will warn you by shifting to two-second increments. This watch has a round black dial with three-hand function and a date window at the three oclock position. Large, Lumibrite hands and markers make the watch easy to read both day and night. The watch is set in a stainless steel bezel with TiCN plating. This plating process, which uses a compound of titanium, carbon, and nitride, creates a lustrous black satin finish. Other features of this watch include a scratch-resistant curved Hardlex crystal and a screw-down caseback. The watch is presented on a stainless steel link bracelet that fastens with a push-button release clasp. Water-tested to 100 meters, this watch is suitable for both swimming and snorkeling.
Kinetic: A powerhouse in technological innovationLike mechanical and quartz, Kinetic is a platform. Over the past 20 years, SEIKO has created on this platform a suite of Kinetic movements, each bringing unique features to the consumer.It was at the 1986 Basel Fair that SEIKO unveiled its first Kinetic prototype. Introduced under the trial name of 'AGM', it was the first watch in the world to convert kinetic movement into electrical energy. It was the first step in a development that, 20 years later, has made Kinetic synonymous with environmental friendliness, high performance and long-lasting convenience to a generation of users worldwide. From the launch in 1988 of the first commercially available watch (then under the new name AGS) until today, over eight million Kinetic watches have been sold (as of 2007).In 1998, Kinetic Auto Relay was released, extending the 'at-rest' operating period of the watch to a remarkable 4 years. 1999 saw the launch of the Ultimate Kinetic Chronograph, a masterpiece which fused the very best of SEIKO's mechanical and electronic watch making skills, and in 2003 another Kinetic Chronograph was launched. At Baselworld 2005, the Kinetic Perpetual made its first appearance, combining Kinetic convenience and longevity with a perpetual calendar, correct to the year 2100. In 2007, SEIKO's emotional technology Kinetic Direct Drive is introduced.

","Following you to whatever destination you will travel the Pro Diver collection. Brushed and polished stainless steel case (40mm diameter 12 thick) and link bracelet. Black dial with luminous hands and hour markers. Convenient date display at the third hour magnified for easy reading. The Invicta Flame Fusion crystal protects the precise Japanese Automatic movement. Water resistant to 200 meters assisted by the screw-down case and crown.
Big, bold and masculine, the Invicta Men's Pro Diver Automatic watch is an affordable luxury watch with classically styled features. This precisely constructed timepiece for men features a solid stainless steel case that's 40mm wide (1.57 inches). It has a black face with Tritnite luminous hands and markers and a unidirectional black bezel with white numerals and markings. Other features include anti-reflective mineral crystal, date display at 3 o'clock, and water resistance to 200 meters. The stainless steel band features highly-polished center links, and is secured by a fold over clasp with safety.
Pro Diver Collection
Plunge into any horizon using the steadfast guidance of the Invicta Pro Diver. Stylishly classic, internal workings are forged with variations of either Swiss chronograph or 21-jewel automatic movements and willingly navigate in depths up to 300 meters. Built with confident prowess, the fortitude with which these timepieces function makes the Pro Diver the quintessential in performance.
Automatic WatchesAutomatic watches do not operate on batteries. Automatic watches are made up of about 130 or more parts that work together to tell time. Automatic movements mark the passage of time by a series of gear mechanisms, and are wound by the movement of your wrist as you wear it. The gear train then transmits the power to the escapement, which distributes the impulses, turning the balance wheel. The balance wheel is the time regulating organ of a mechanical watch, which vibrates on a spiral hairspring. Lengthening or shortening the balance spring makes the balance wheel go faster or slower to advance or retard the watch. The travel of the balance wheel from one extreme to the other and back again is called oscillation. Lastly, automatic movements come in different types, including movements that are Swiss-made, Japanese-made, and more.Also referred to as self-winding, watches with automatic movements utilize kinetic energy, the swinging of your arm, to provide energy to an oscillating rotor to keep the watch ticking. They're considered more satisfying to watch collectors (horologists) because of the engineering artistry that goes into the hundreds of parts that make up the movement. If you do not wear an automatic watch consistently (for about 8 to 12 hours a day), you can keep the watch powered with a watch winder (a great gift for collectors).
Screw Down Crowns: Many Invicta watches are equipped with a screw down crown to help prevent water infiltration. This is most common on our Diver models. In order to adjust the date and/or time on such a watch, you must first unscrew the crown before you can gently pull it out to its first or second click stop position. To do this, simply rotate the crown counterclockwise until it springs open. When you have finished setting the watch, the crown must then be pushed in and screwed back in tightly. Not doing so will cancel the water resistance of the watch and will void all warranties from the manufacturer. Overall, this process should not require a lot of effort or force.
With the watch attached to your wrist, grip the bezel at the three o'clock and nine o'clock points and slowly twist counterclockwise.

","Elegant, luxurious, yet never too much, the shock-resistant and anti-magnetic Men's Bracelet Calendar Watch from Bulova is part of the distinguished Infinity collection. A gold-tone bezel with eight etched Roman numeral adds warmth and depth, while a sleek white dial gets its uptown look from single and double gold-tone bar markers, black indices, and matchstick-thin gold-tone hands. A two-tone bracelet lends polish, while water resistance to 99 feet ensures extra protection from the elements. There's also a date display at three o'clock to help keep your day on-track, and a scratch-resistant crystal for extra protection.

In 1875, a young Czech immigrant named Joseph Bulova set up shop in New York City, and a legendary American watch brand was born. Bulova was trained as a jeweler, and his expertise carried over into his watchmaking career, which began around 1911 with boudoir clocks and pocket watches, and soon evolved to include what was then one of the latest and most fashionable technological innovations: the wristwatch.
Bulova introduced its first line of wristwatches in 1919. The company grew and prospered, and soon early radio and television ads were declaring, ""America runs on Bulova time."" In the 1950s, continuing its legacy of innovation, Bulova introduced Accutron, the first electronic watch, and the first breakthrough in timekeeping technology in over 300 years. The Accutron timing mechanism was later adapted for use by NASA computers and a Bulova timer was even placed on the moon to control transmissions of data. Bulova timepieces have kept official time aboard Air Force One and have also served as official timepieces for U.S. Olympic teams.
Today, Bulova maintains its tradition of excellence in technology and design, offering a diverse collection of beautiful precision timepieces for every occasion.

Pulsar by Seiko Holdings Corporation.
A spectacular breakthrough  Pulsar was born in an age of optimism. In the 1970's, everything seemed achievable through the rapidly growing technological expertise at the world's fingertips. Space flight had been converted from dream to reality, computer science was developing at break neck speed and electronics seemed to deliver new advances every day. Pulsar symbolized the age. It was new and it was bold, it was surprising and it was different. Pulsar, the world's first electronic digital watch, created a sensation when it was unveiled in New York in 1972 and it changed the world's perception of time.
A tradition of difference When the brand was taken into the Seiko Corporation in 1980, it brought further surprises to the world; the first calculator watch in 1980 and the first all-quartz watch line in 1981 were among its industry-leading achievements. And throughout the '80's and 90's Pulsar continued to bring to market new products that were born to be different. The Avant-garde collection in 1980's set a new style in women's watches and Spoon in 1990's were unique designs which further cemented Pulsar's image as an ingenious and surprising watchmaker.
Towards a modernist future
Today, Pulsar remains loyal to its heritage. It was born to be different and it will remain so. Each Pulsar watch has the hint of the futurism and modernity that have always been its hallmark. Pulsar is a brand for the individual who appreciates real value and seeks quality with individuality and flair.

Pulsar by Seiko Holdings Corporation.
A spectacular breakthrough  Pulsar was born in an age of optimism. In the 1970's, everything seemed achievable through the rapidly growing technological expertise at the world's fingertips. Space flight had been converted from dream to reality, computer science was developing at break neck speed and electronics seemed to deliver new advances every day. Pulsar symbolized the age. It was new and it was bold, it was surprising and it was different. Pulsar, the world's first electronic digital watch, created a sensation when it was unveiled in New York in 1972 and it changed the world's perception of time.
A tradition of difference When the brand was taken into the Seiko Corporation in 1980, it brought further surprises to the world; the first calculator watch in 1980 and the first all-quartz watch line in 1981 were among its industry-leading achievements. And throughout the '80's and 90's Pulsar continued to bring to market new products that were born to be different. The Avant-garde collection in 1980's set a new style in women's watches and Spoon in 1990's were unique designs which further cemented Pulsar's image as an ingenious and surprising watchmaker.
Towards a modernist future
Today, Pulsar remains loyal to its heritage. It was born to be different and it will remain so. Each Pulsar watch has the hint of the futurism and modernity that have always been its hallmark. Pulsar is a brand for the individual who appreciates real value and seeks quality with individuality and flair.
