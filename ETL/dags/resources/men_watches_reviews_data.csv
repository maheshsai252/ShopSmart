"This watch was only about $13 shipped, so I'm not going to complain that much. It tells time, and that's what it is supposed to do. The buttons however need to be in a different place. I have to reach all the way over to the left top button to turn on the light to see the time in the dark. That is already a hassle when holding something in my right hand (I wear the watch on my left wrist), but to top it off, you need to hold down the button to keep the light on. Maybe I'm spoiled, but that seems ridiculous. I have had plenty of watches by Casio and all of them kept the light on for a few seconds when you pressed the light button. There aren't any fancy modes on this watch, like stopwatch or timer. The only modes are Time, Alarm, and Set Time. There isn't even a dedicated button for adjusting the time; you have to hit the mode button until the seconds start flashing. This watch is fine for someone who doesn't want to spend a lot of money and only wants to tell time, but the light should at least stay on for a few seconds.",OK for the price; needs better button arrangement,3.0,9792252916
This is the 3rd one of these watches my husband has bought over a period of around 8 years. Cheap and cheerful - not worth the cost of a new battery so we just replace it each time. Overall a great watch for the money.,3rd one purchased,5.0,9792252916

"3 and a half stars.
First, the Amazon Partner who is selling this, J & R Music & Computer World, gets a 5 star rating from me, the watch arrived very fast and in excellent condition.
The watch itself gets the 3 and a half because, while the actual purchase price is ""$9.99"", the crossed-out list price is ""$24.95"". I expected a little more from a $25.00 Casio. My complaints: The illumination is a small side light, not an entire screen brightness like with other Casios or Indiglow style. The stop-watch goes only to 59 Minutes, 59 Seconds.
Good things:
1-button press to go from 12 to 24 hour time, alarm function, hourly beep, light weight, slim profile, 50 meter water resistant, 7-year battery, and easy to use.
Maybe I'm overly critical, this is a good $10.00 watch, but an average $25.00 watch.

[EDIT]:
Having had this watch for several months now, I find that it keeps better time than a much more expensive digital watch that I had bought at Disney World. The Disney watch looks great and is all metal, but runs faster than the Casio. I compare and set the time of all my watches to my Casio Atomic/Solar MTG920DA, which receives a time calibration every day from the Atomic clock in Fort Collins, CO.",Good Basic Digital Watch - 3 and a half stars,4.0,9792252916

"I have had this watch for 4 years now and I still have the original battery in it! I honestly cannot believe it hasn't died. I wear a watch every single day, and I've had this watch on my wrist for AT LEAST 90% of the time, over the last 4 years. Been with me countless times in the oceans of Latin America, Mexico, California coast and Hawaii (yes I know it's the same ocean, just wanted to emphasize how it's been in the water a lot). Never had any issues with it, in relation to water. Great watch that tells the date, day of the week, time, and has a stopwatch. The band is just now beginning to crack, but if the band breaks, I can just buy another one because it is so cheap!

**Update (04/13/2018): The band finally broke all the way after almost 5 years, and the battery never died. Bought a brand new one for the price of a battery replacement, or new band, and expect the same lifespan out of a quality product.","4 Years Strong, Love This Watch!",5.0,9792252916
"Watch face will migrate to the side of the wrist for most people because you'll be using one of the last few holes in the band to buckle the strap, even if you have skinny wrists like mine. That issue should be familiar to people who've had old school Casios before. Otherwise it's pretty much your bog-standard Casio, with a bit more water resist. Doesn't stick up enough to interfere with garden/sporting activities. May not be bulky enough for those into the big-watch thing.

"I must ""love it"" as I have been buying this same watch for over 20 years. The truth is that I am hard on watches and I have a large wrist. This watch fits my wrist, it is cheap enough that I don't worry about abusing it, it lights up when I need it to and it lasts about two years before the band breaks (from the large wrist) and I need to buy another. In case anyone wonders what I do with all of the watches with broken bands, I trim the band to a nice rounded shape and give them to my grandchildren to use. The grandchildren get about another two years out it (if they don't lose it first) before the battery gives out.","Reasonably Durable, Cheap Watch with a Large Wrist Band",5.0,9792252916
"This is an inexpensive watch and for the money it's an good buy.  I have a different model of a Casio watch that has been through a lot and is still running after 15 years.  The battery has never been replaced.  Really!
The only possible problem with the W59-1V watch is that the band seems a  bit on the small side.  I'm not an huge guy, but it's necessary to have the strap buckled a couple holes from the end.  A longer band would be an improvement.  By the way - the older watch has a longer, wider band.","A good, inexpensive watch.",4.0,9792252916

It looks like this watch is suitable for children but not adults of average size.  I think I will stick to buying watches in the store in future where I can at least try it for size.

A solid watch. Very subtle and goes with a lot of outfits. I haven't bought a watch with a light in a while so I was surprised to find out this has a pretty bad frontlight.

"This is such a cool watch.  It is unbelievably thin, weighs practically nothing, and has very classic, understated graphics that feel retro and fresh all at the same time.  It is also unbelievably inexpensive.  It is rather small, but as an unobtrusive sport watch, I much prefer this minimalist, classic aesthetic over a chunky ""g-shock"" offerings.

"I believe Casio is one of the few companies in the world producing digital devices/electronics where you actually get more than what you pay for. It's incredible to sell a product with these specs for $12. This is a very simple, no BS wrist watch that: tells time (day date time), a few basic functions (alarm, stopwatch, light), solid water resistance/durability... and that's it. The particular W59 that I received runs about +1 to +1.5 seconds per month so far, which is simply astonishing. I could literally wait a few years before the time was far enough off to feel like I had to adjust it (for my standards anyway). Not all W59 out there will run that well, standard spec should be within 30 seconds per month. So, I'm pretty lucky to get one that is that good. I have done lap swimming with it many times for over an hour each time and no leaks so far (don't push the buttons while wet or underwater though... and ymmv). Keep in mind, the watch is extremely small by today's standards, the strap kind of sucks and the light is terrible compared to an illuminator back light. I don't mind the small size, and actually appreciate the light weight and fewer knocks on things. I swapped the strap to a tan nato (18mm fits, it is a very tight fit between case and pins, if you try this you'll need to be patient and have the right tools to avoid beating up the lugs/pins). The light is acceptable for me from a functionality standpoint... you can tell the time in the dark. Overall, it's a great value, and if I was traveling overseas, or doing any kind of outdoor activity I'd be wearing this.. or an F91... or a 5600... or.. well you get the point. If you don't like it, it was 12 bucks, so not the end of the world for most people. For the money, I can't think of a better value proposition.",I could literally wait a few years before the time was far enough off to feel like I had to adjust it (for my standards anyway),5.0,9792252916

"First thing you'll notice about this watch is its incredible weight.  It's super light compared to those big clunky stainless steel watches.  I had this watch for over 5 years, and I got scratches on the crystal from normal use.  So don't expect this thing to be completely scratch resistant.

Well the low ratings has to due with the poor service and build quality.  The ""chrome indicators"" that mark the hours actually came loose inside my watch.  I sent it to Skagen under their lifetime warranty to repair it.  Guess what, it happed THREE times already...same exact problem.  I've spent over 30$ just shipping the watch back and forth.

Again, I really like the watch, but the problems with things falling out, and poor repair service, I can only rate this watch a 3 star.",Great design..but quality is terrible,3.0,B0000643Q8
"This is the second version of this watch that I have owned.  The first one got some water in it after wearing it in a jacuzzi so the water resisitant is pretty liberal.  This watch has a very classic look and I frequently get comments on it.  I also own the same one in Black and both are pretty much identical.

Skagen was one of the first brands to go titanium in both the watch and bands and more and more companies are switching.  Titanium is lighter and stronger than regular steel and once you go Titanium, you won't go back.

This watch has a small face so its perfect for people with average to small wrist sizes.  Some of these watches have faces that are so big its like wearing a tea saucer on your wrist and it's an eysore.  This watch is a revelation to smaller wrists everywhere.  Also the band on this watch does not grab your wrist hair (VERY IMPORTANT!).

One disadvantage of this watch is the lack of features.  Its got the date and thats about it.  Also the ticking from the watch is loud enought that you sometimes notice it if the watch is within about 2 feet of your ears and the room is silent.  I wouldn't normally go to bed with this watch or store it nearby while sleeping.

Then lo and behold, my eyes were drawn to this Skagen. At last, I had found a sleek watch with classic styling that didn't cost a fortune, and that you don't see everywhere! I was excited.

People from various age groups (teenager, mom, yuppies) have asked about the watch because it's a subtle classy elegant watch.  This would make a great present for that special someone or for yourself.

If you want to adjust the chain, go to a local watch shop.  It should take less than 5 minutes and cost about $6.  Don't do it at a major brand name store.  They charge $15 and you may have to wait.

"Keeping this review as short as possible I'll try to be as objective as possible.

I purchased this watch from Amazon in 2006 and and had to change the battery six months ago. Still looks and works like new.

Pros:
Inexpensive quality time piece.
Very lightweight and hardly noticeable when on my wrist.
Tough titanium band/casing doesn't scratch or blemish.
Crystal still scratch free.
Extremely accurate never needs setting (unlike the clock in my Toyota).

Cons:
The stem for setting the time and date is smooth, small and difficult for me to use, especially when setting the date. The date window is so teeny I can't read it anyway so that's no biggie -  My iPhone, computer, and coffee cup have legible date & time displays.

The No So Good: I don't care for the clasp. It's very easy to catch it on things and have it pop open. I ended up bending it a tiny bit so it didn't open so easily. The directions that came with with the watch to adjust the band were printed so small, I actually needed a magnifier to read. When I did, I found the band this watch comes with, was not the same type in the directions to re-size it.

"Ownership period: I have had this watch for 8 years (mine has grey face instead of black).  I got it for $100 at a Sunglasses Hut.

Ticking: The watch ticks louder at the 9-2 position, inaudible otherwise.  Since I sleep in absolute quiet, I can hear it by my bedside.  I often pick it up off the nightstand and toss it across the room.  Can't hear it unless it is dead quiet and within a few feet.

Clasp: After a few years, I had to adjust the catch on the clasp, since it started coming loose (I wear it pretty tight).  I was worried about breaking it off, but I was careful and it worked out fine.

Links: When I took the links out initially, I used a safety pin. No biggie.  I've adjusted it easily a few times since using the holes for quick adjustment on the clasp.

Activities: I've worn this watch almost every day doing almost anything from working outside to swimming.  I replaced the battery twice, I figure I'm due for another battery change soon. Last time, I did the change myself at Wal-Mart using their tools.

Accuracy: I set the watch EXACTLY to my phone every stupid time change.  I think it loses a second or two every few months.

Finish: Scratches from working outside show up under close scrutiny, but the grey hides it very well.  I never notice it. (we are not talking big scratches... hairline)

Weight: I thought I lost it, and then found it on my wrist a few hours later.  No joke. (in my defense, I was wearing a long sleeve shirt)

If I lost it: I'd flip my lid.  It is just one of those things that are a part of me.

"I bought my Skagen 105LTX back in late 2000. Ten years I have worn this watch, and it has held up better than I could have ever hoped. It has seen ocean water, chlorinated swimming pools, motor oil, gasoline, solvent, sweat, and extreme cold. It has only ever needed two batteries, a new crystal, and a new clasp.

The scratch I got on the crystal was from a bolt on the bottom of an engine block, and without the watch I would've needed stitches on my wrist, without a doubt. The clasp wore out after eight years from having taking the watch on and off several thousand times, and was easily replaceable with a nearly identical Seiko clasp. Everything else is still in exactly the shape it was when I got it. This watch does not 'wear out'.

If this ever comes back to the Amazon store, or if you're interested enough to shop around for it, Skagen 105LTX definitely won't disappoint. It's a great timepiece for those who value simplicity, class, and functionality over 'bling' factor.

My only qualm with the watch is that it has a second hand. It's nearly silent, but I sleep with my arm over my face and the subtle ticking of the watch wakes me up if I fall asleep with it on. Obviously that won't apply to/bother normal people.

One thing to note though - the face on mine is the same titanium gray as the body... Not black like in the image. I don't know if they have updated the model, or if that's just a weird picture of it, but the face is definitely not black.",Lasting Investment,4.0,B0000643Q8

I got this primarily because it's one of the cheaper watches that doesn't cause me to break out--it's all titanium, so there's no nickel to irritate the skin. Works well in the regard.

The only drawback is that you have to go to a jeweler to shorten the band, but that's hardly a big deal. It cost about $5 at a discount jeweler.",Great,5.0,B0000643Q8

"I originally found out about Skagen when I went shopping at a Dillard's with my wife for a watch and fell in love with it because I found it to be ultra-light and slim. Since I don't like heavy or bulky watches, I thought that it would be a great buy but hated the price (which was $124 and NOT on sale).

So I turned to the Internet and came across the exact same watch on Amazon for $74. At first, I was excited about this bargain but then I read some of the reviews and started to rethink my pending purchase. There were a decent number of reviews where people said that the watch was cheap and that it basically broke down within two years so I was started to second guess my intention to purchase it. But after speaking with a family member about his Skagen watch, I learned that these watches are actually decently made. The family member had his Skagen watch for three years and loved it -- he got the battery replaced at his local mall without a hitch (this was one of the complaints).

So, I've taken the plunge and bought this one and I love it! So far, so good (I've had it for a couple of months and no issues!). I hope that it lasts like my Citizen watch did (I had my previous watch for 7+ years).",Don't Believe the Bad Reviews!,5.0,B0000643Q8

"I have three Skagen watches. They are beautiful. However here are the issues I have with them:

Most importantly, everything about this watch is propriatery. Changing batteries is a pain as you can't find them locally and it costs $14.95. Bands are $34.95. Also you better keep your sales receipt even though they have lifetime warranty.

I sent in my replacement band and battery with payment for two watches in July and they cashed the check and didn't receive anything until January.  I called them and they promised to send a free battery, but when I received the items finally in March, no battery was included (let alone a free one).

Other issues:

a) Wire mesh bands: The clasp is not always tight and over time will slide and get a little loose. Also the titanium mesh is made of tiny small circles of metal interlocked and if one of them gets open (say you hit something), it starts unraveling slowly but surely.

b) Leather band: The one I have fell apart so quickly it is surprising. It also started smelling bad due to sweat (I do not sweat that much and I owned other watches with leather bands). This seems to be a very bad quality.

c) Water - my watch started fogging after 2 years of light usage.

I will NOT buy another Skagen watch. Their customer service and business practices are shady. They are great watches when they work.

I am now an owner of a Citizen watch.",Stay away from Skagen,1.0,B0000643Q8
"Bought this watch as a gift which was well received, but my friend ran into problems when he tried to adjust the band length to fit his wrist.  No department store could deal with these types of links and he had to go through a couple jewelry stores before finding one that was able to work with the band.  Just a heads up, which we didn't have.  Otherwise the watch itself is great.","Beautiful watch, some difficulty with adjusting band",4.0,B0000643Q8
"I've had this for a year and a half.  I wish it had been a better watch -- I wasted $70.

It's a very attractive watch.  BUT -- the clasp is useless.  I had to adjust it several times in order to keep it clamped shut, and now the little holding-tab is so soft that I can move it with my thumbnail.

Also, the ""super hardened mineral crystal"" (that's what it says on the case) is all scratched up.

Skagen has a limited lifetime warranty on its watches -- but it doesn't cover the strap or the crystal.

Let's face it as Men, we don't wear much jewelry and so I think it's important to make a good choice with your watches.  On the negative side, the calender date is too small for almost anyone to see, the adjustment knob is very hard to pull out, and the clasp sticks out a little even when it's closed.

"Inexpensive, nice-looking, lightweight. It is also quiet, contrary to other reviewers' impressions. Maybe this varies for each particular watch? In that case, I am lucky. Generally it is a great watch.

 The only small but annoying thing about this watch has to do with its metal link strap. As you wear the watch, the links move against each other and lock on the hairs on your wrist, pulling on them. Ouch! I have had this watch for about a week and this happens once or twice every hour. It is not unbearable, but it is mildly annoying. Maybe I will get used to it over time.

"For years, men in my family who have worked in construction, steel mills, farming, etc. have chosen this watch because of its heavy-duty, industrial like quality.  These watches are simply perfect for heavy work. I've seen my father chip concrete off of his Timex watch and it being as good as new.  I've given countless Timex watches to my father, uncles and grandfathers and anticipate that I will continue to do so.

These watches are simple.  The only ""fancy"" extra is the addition of a button that the user can press to see the time at night.  The numbers are large so you don't have to squint to read them.  The second hand on the watch is very accurate making it possible to use the watch like a stop watch, if necessary.

The watches are waterproof -- they never steam up.  Wear them in the shower, in a rain storm or while swimming and they will emerge fine.

The watches do have limits and I have bought replacements when my father has broken the face or when he has worn the plating off of the band.  These situations have been maybe once or twice over the last decade.

This is a good, heavy-duty watch and is perfect for those who just need to know the time and, perhaps, require a watch that can withstand demanding work like construction.",Perfect for those who have demanding jobs and/or just want a simple watch,5.0,B00006I5XQ

I had looked at getting him a more pricey, kinetic watch with lots of features and styling, but I know he just absolutely LOVES the Timex Indiglo feature and the expandable band, plus the easy-read dial is great for reading the time with his glasses off.

As was mentioned earlier, the clasp is the only downside to this watch.  But it's also a big plus.  Here's why...

The latching mechanism itself can be difficult to close (which is why I held back one star in my rating), but it's design also allows for infinite adjustment settings.  No longer are you locked into a preset number of sizes based on where the manufacturer drilled holes.  This band has a sliding adjustment that can be set ANYWHERE.

"Besides the styling, which you can decide for yourself based on the picture,

What I like about this watch is:

1) It is a nice size for someone with a smaller wrist- if a larger watch looks ridiculously clunky on your wrist this will more likely work for you.

2) It has held up remarkably well- I tend to run into doors and walls absentmindedly and have 3 or 4 broken watches to show for it. It's also possible (but unlikely) that I haven't run into anything recently.

3) The links don't chafe your skin like watches with this style band occasionally do.

What I don't like about this watch:

1) I occasionally have a hard time with the clasp when I take it off; if you have arthritis it will be more difficult to take off.  It will also come flying off occasionally and hit the ground (see item 2 in what I like about the watch)

2) The clasp is too much fun to open and close- It will also fly off when I absentmindedly open and close it.

It's also fairly distinctive; I've gotten several comments about it and even one offer to buy it. How about 10 bucks for it?, I was asked. (I said no)

Thin is the key, as most watches are so bulky (especially the expensive ones), and this watch is very thin.

I had a little trouble adjusting the mesh band, but so far, it's holding up nicely. It actually looks more expensive than it is.",Nice watch--just what I wanted,4.0,B0000C9ZBS
I have worn this watch almost every day for the past two months since I've urchased this watch and it its perhaps one of the lightest more comfortable watches I have ever even tried on let alone owned.  People are always complimenting it for its sleekness and attractivness.  and this is the only metal band that does not pull the hair from your arm,"comfortable, light and attractive",5.0,B0000C9ZBS
"Nice slim watch ,can be casual or dressy, womans watch to match is 233sss.

"First time I tried to put on the watch, I had to bend the tab to get the band to clasp properly.  Then the adjustment piece came loose while wearing and off came the watch.  Put it all back together, it worked for a couple of weeks until it again needed adjustment.  It is an ongoing problem.

Today I went outside.  The crystal broke spontaneously as soon as the cold air hit the face.

The watch looks nice, but it is poorly made.  My advice would be to stay away from Skagen until they change the band clasp system and correct their crystal breakage problems.",Crystal Cracked with Cold...Band Clasp is Cheap/ Falls Apart,1.0,B0000C9ZBS
"I love the design of this watch.  It looks even better that what you see on screen.  The thinness is very cool.

However, my band is starting to come apart after only four uses.  I am very careful with my things and do not abuse them.  I would expect a metal band to last a long time, but this one is coming apart on one side where it's welded to the bracket that holds the pin to the case.

I called Skagen in NV and they said ""sorry, we only warrant the movement, not the band.""  After pointing out that I expected the band to last more that four days, the lady transferred me to someone's voicemail in order to get rid of me.  Classy, Skagen.

This watch is great if you only plan to use it occasionally.  Otherwise, look for something more sturdy.  Other Skagen watches I own have worked great, but not this one.","Nice design.  Subpar materials.  Poor, poor warranty service.",2.0,B0000C9ZBS

Like most metal bands you are at risk of losing a few hairs; however, much less than most.  The watch is lightweight but durable (I have already smacked it against a door jam).  The watch is also very quiet (I can only hear the ticking when the watch is up against my ear).  The only thing I do not like about the watch is the date is small and hard to read.

Sleek dark face with pin dot dial markers make it easy to read time while keeping the face classy. No numbers except the date which is small but good enough to help. Thin body and band are a great alternative to heavy thick watches. The band is not difficult to latch once you get used to it. The watch is a steal. Comes with a battery.,Sleek look yet very easy to read.,5.0,B0000C9ZCQ
"In the price range, skagen undoubtedly has the nicest watch designs I've seen but unfortunately it's not enough to overcome the problems they have designing functional bands. In less than a year, I paid twice to have broken pins repaired and then gave up when the mesh came unattached from the pin connection and the watch would have needed repair a third time.
I know the watch comes with a warranty I didn't take advantage of, but this is an irrelevant point to me. To warranty the watch, I would have had to pay $8.95 to skagen in addition to paying shipping and wait weeks for the watch to come back. What good is that? If I was a ""good customer"" and followed skagen's procedures, I would have paid at least $40 on top of the price of the watch, within a year, just to keep it functioning. I take very good care of my watches and didn't wear this on a daily basis either, it simply has an awfully designed pin assembly. About the same time I bought this watch, I got a skagen as a gift for my girlfriend and to no surprise, it has had the same problems. I just love giving gifts that I have to regularily take to be repaired....","Great watch, awful band",2.0,B0000C9ZCQ
"I am very happy with the purchase of this watch.  After reading some of the other reviews I was a little worried about the difficulty in operating the bracelet latch and the possiblility of the glass face shattering in cold weather that others had reported.

Also, the bracelet latch is unique in how it works, but I wouldn't call it confusing.",very satisfied,5.0,B0000C9ZCQ

"Skagen is my new favorite watchmaker because of their overall comfort, quality and design. The affordable price of their watches, relative to the thoughtfullness and quality that goes into every aspect of them, is quite remarkable.

Both the steel and titanium mesh bands are extremely comfortable and very durable. They don't irritate or leave discolored markings on the skin. The clasp system is easy to open & close and is quite reliable.

I love the simplicity and elegance of this watch. The color of the dial is a deep, dark grey; almost black. The hours and minute indicators are  slightly raised, metal bullet points. There is a subtle, brushed finish on the dial that radiates a gorgeous sheen from its center. The hour and minute hands are simple silver-colored flat pins. The thinness of the watch makes it a pleasure to wear and doesn't snag on shirt cuffs.

My only negative comment is that it takes some effort to read the numbers of the dates because their extremely small size in the window.

Purchased this watch from amazon for use at work.  Item is very well made with a thin outer base with a slightly higher inner center (about the size of a dime).

Quite thin at 5 mm, adding to the tastefulness.  One reviewer of the mesh bracelet said it snags; I don't find that at all.  Watch case is polished steel, not brushed; it might scratch/dull unevenly over time but that's hard to predict.  Not a lot of contrast between face background (a kind of oyster-white) and the goldtone stick time markers on the face, so buyers with poor eyesight should be aware of that.  No second hand, but it's a dress watch.  Overall, very impressive for the money.",high value,5.0,B0000C9ZBQ
"It would be hard to find a classier watch.  A few things to consider, though, before buying.  The picture of the watch sold for $58.99 by Watchsavings on Amazon is not quite accurate.  That picture appears to show black hands and markings and a black ring around the watch face.  The one I received (which is still beautiful) is gold accents only, no black at all. [Note: the other pages offering this same model watch by other sellers for higher prices DO depict the watch accurately.] If this is what you want, great.  If you're getting far-sighted with the passage of years, though, the reduced contrast between gold and the white face will have you peering momentarily to read the hands. Not a major gripe, but some may be bothered more than I.  Also, don't overlook that it has no second hand.  Having said all this, I still think it's a gorgeous watch and it's my second Skagen.  Will probably get more.","Elegant, but be aware of some features.",5.0,B0000C9ZBQ

"I finally decided to write a review for this watch since I've owned it for about 4 years.

This watch is simply fantastic for the price. It is extremely thin and will slide under any dress shirt. The mesh band is simply phenomenal - it looks good and is very fast/easy to put on. The clasp hasn't failed me in 4 years of continuous use. I like that the watch is small - I have small wrists. The mineral crystal is actually pretty good, I've worn the watch for 4 years and there is only a tiny barely visible small scratch on the crystal. I have replaced the battery once and it is very straightforward to do it yourself.

Pros:
-Mesh band looks and feels premium
-Mesh band is easily adjustable for any wrist size (no tools required)
-keeps time very well
-super thin!
-price

Cons:
-the watch is small, while I really like that - people with larger wrists may want to look elsewhere
-in some lighting conditions the watch is difficult to read because of the gold hands and steel dial

"I had my doubts, I have to say that a year ago I gave the same exact model to my father. My father is one that once he puts the clock he will not remove it, therefore he works with it in any type of tasks around the house and the glass left his place, although there is a possibility that he used improperly. Also I was not able to claim warranty because I lost the bill. This time I would not make the same mistake! So I want to give it another try  to this watch because of their appearance and price. I like especially its a light and thin clock, the original wrist's design and the reliable machine. I give it a 4 star considering what I said above and  the fast delivery.

Yo tena mis dudas, tengo que decir que le di el mismo modelo a mi padre, mi padre es aquel que una vez que pone algo que le gusta no se lo quita, por lo que trabajo con el en cualquier tipo de tareas alrededor de la casa, que con el tiempo el cristal se salio de su lugar, hay la posibilidad de que lo haya utilizado in-apropiadamente. Adems no pude reclamar garanta porque habia perdido la factura. Esta vez no cometere el mismo error! Por eso quiero darle otra oportunidad a este reloj debido a su apariencia y precio.

"I loved this watch. It looks cool, it's weightless on, it seemed durable, and I've recieved a bunch of compliments. The problem that I've had is that the crystal broke without provocation. I never hit it on anything or dropped the watch, I just woke up one day and it had two big cracks that run through the center of the face. I have had this watch for less than 3 months. To make it worse I had another one just like it right before this one and the same thing happened in less than two weeks. I thought that the first was a lemon or something and liked everything about the watch, except what had happened, so I choose an even exchange. Wrong choice. The titanium is strong, but the crystal is week. My advice is: DO NOT BUY THIS WATCH. don't be charmed by its style or seemingly strong construction. I should also say that I've gone back to the swatch that I've had for about 6 years now, which has never had any problems. i mention this only to compair the durability of crystals in the two products and to note that the crystal cracked during normal use, not agrivated.",poor construction,1.0,B0000C9ZDM
"Selecting Skagen, I thought I was buying a quality watch... Far from that.

It may look beautiful, but in a week or so after you start wearing it, its black polish starts to fade, leaving awful white patches..

"But then, that's what I love about Skagen, their design sensibility. Had the watch for two weeks now and love it, especially the thin design, which helps me when I am typing on my MacBook Pro laptop -- it doesn't hit the metal ledge like my other Skagen watch, which was thin, but not this thin. My only disappointment was the clasp and the reason for the one star deduction. It's needs precision to get it closed, rather a light touch, but I'm sure I will get used to it.

"The first thing to note is that the Timex web site claims a three-year battery life, while Amazon claims eight years.  I hope Amazon is right, but you should know what the manufacturer thinks ;)

My wife chose this watch because of its looks, and I must admit that it looks rather nice.  This is definately no-frills.  No compass, no alarm, no stopwatch.  But it tells the time and date.

Besides looking sharp, my favorite thing is the size/weight -- it is rather thin and light.  I wanted a watch with more features, but I could not stand the thought of something larger and heavier.

There is really not much to complain about.  The date display is rather small.  The band is also advertised as being ""water resistant leather"" but I would not want to take it swimming.  Only time will tell how it hold up.  I also do not know why watch manufacturers continue to use cheap zinc glow powder for the hands.  Newer strontium-based powders are available that still glow great after eight hours.  Oh well, all manufacturers do this, and it can light up the entire face so the glow powder is really not even needed.

So, to summarize, it is small and light for a metal men's watch, and it looks great.  Guys, one look at this and the ladies will know that you are a man who is comfortable in the deep woods.","Looks great, works great.",4.0,B0000TIISW

And I am constantly walking into walls, come into a room *bam* right on the threshold. There is plenty of paint on the face which has to get fingernailed off every so ofter.

"I am on my second Expedition watch and still love 'em. It keeps time to within 10-15 seconds per month. Ironically, it can run a little fast for a while, and then run a little slow for a while.

My only problem is that the case tends to get corroded after about two years of constant wearing, and then scratches the skin.

Then, I would keep on buying them; for myself and as gifts. It really is a great watch.

Pros:

1. Crisp, clear face numbers.

2. Easy to set date/time.

Cons:

1. nylon band.

 I have  been used to a resin band (for over 10 years), so switching to nylon was immediately felt by me. The band seems scratchy to my skin. I suppose it will get better over time.

2. plastic watch face.

 It is raised, off the face of the watch, without protection, so it seems easily vulnerable to sratches.  And indeed, within 24 hours, a sratch has occured to the face. I'm not sure how over time this will play out.

 I can't tell if this is the same situation with the Timex Men's Camper Watch #T18581, which was the other watch I was considering to buy.","looks nice, but vulnerable cover and scratchy band",3.0,B0000TIIUK
"My husband is hard on watches; so, after buying him several expensive watches, I stopped and opted for inexpensive watches at discount stores.  Unfortunately, in many cases, you get what you pay for.  Not so with this Timex Camper Expedition.  It is worth more than the price.  It keeps good time; of course, that's required.  But in addition, the band is comfortable and indestructable.  On other cheap watches, the bands have been a problem as they crack or fall apart and then the pins make them difficult or impossible to replace.  This Timex has no pins to remove for band replacement.  So far, that's not an issue because the band has held up great.  Also, at age 62, some watch faces are difficult to read.  This face is clear and bold.  I would recommend it for anyone.",Great watch for the price,5.0,B0000TIIUK

"I purchased this watch back in 2002, and it just stopped working recently when it had been washed with a load of laundry. Normally that is not a problem, but the adjustment dial broke off and I didn't know it. The dial has an o-ring on it to prevent water from getting into the watch. So in the end the watch filled with water and ruined the battery, it looked pretty rusty to. I carried this watch in my pocket, I adjust both straps up so it's like the watch is hanging from one strap. It felt better in my pocket than on my wrist, so I always carried it that way. The only complaint I have is that the watch has the dial completely exposed, you will see, a lot of watches have the body of the watch built around the dial somewhat, to protect it from damage. Which was the only problem my watch ever had, the dial broke off. This watch was with me every day for about 12-13 year, and it is still a great watch for the money.",Great Watch,5.0,B0000TIIUK

The band however, because it's nylon keeps catching threads when I buckle it and is sometimes difficult to strap on.. My real complaint, though, is the indigo light.

"I purchased this watch because I was looking for a simple analog watch that was easy to read in all lighting conditions (I often hike in late afternoons).  The item photo shown here, up to at least 14 Sept.'11, showed the watch as having a white face and wide, black hands; this looked like a great combination that would satisfy my requirement.  But the watch I received had the white face but not the wide, black hands; instead, the hands were narrow and had a cream-colored luminescent interior.  So instead of being immediately visible in failing light, they were barely-visible thin outlines.  Further, the luminescent strips were too narrow to be easily seen, and were entirely superfluous anyway, as the dial had the Timex Indiglo feature providing contrast.

I don't know on what basis Timex decided to change the older design of wide, black hands to the new one (it
probably involved economics), but I consider the new configuration to be much less useful - by 80% or so.  All of the other possible sources - and I've checked many - of this model watch that shows the older hands are also incorrect: the hands are the actually the newer outline type.  Timex has said two weeks ago they will update the image shown to reflect the newer version, but so far this has not happened.  If this visibility aspect of the watch is not a concern for you, then the other buyers' comments apply.  But you should be forewarned about what to expect.

I initially sent my new watch to Timex to get the version, or the hands, replaced for the older type, but after several weeks of ridiculous back-and-forths learned that Timex either would not or could not make such a replacement.  All-in-all a very disappointing experience from Timex.  But Amazon's responsiveness and willingness to accommodate for circumstances were admirable.  In the end I decided to keep the watch, and after confirming thru use how useless the hands were, have given it to a watch repair store to replace those asinine hands with wide, black ones.

"For a few dollars more than it would have cost me to have the battery replaced in my Swiss Army watch - which now sits at the bottom of a junk drawer - I was able to get this very easy to read and very comfortable to wear Timex. It even looks like my Swiss Army watch with its black case, white face and contrasting black numerals. So I guess I've defected from the Swiss Army to become a member of the Timex expeditionary force... How cool is that! Oh, and my Swiss Army watch didn't light up like this Timex can.. Go indiglo !!!
I have not had this Timex long, so I can't say if it is going to scratch. If it does, no big deal. The band is nothing fancy, but what do you expect for just over 20 bucks, hand crafted alligator?
As for style, it sure ain't one of those clown clocks I see in stores and on cable tv. I suppose if my wrist were as thick as a utility pole one of those mega-size watches on steroids might look nice. This Timex has a modest case diameter of 38mm.
Now I do have one tiny gripe. The date window is so small I just cannot see the numerals. No biggy, if I can't remember the date I'll pick up a newspaper. Great watch, great price and I will wear it to every occasion.","Fits small wrists, is easy to read and comfortable to wear",5.0,B0000TIIUK
"I've worn this watch every day for about five years, and I am buying an identical replacement because this is one of the best watches I have ever owned. Everybody I know compliments me on the attractiveness of the design, including the typeface of the numerals.

The watch is a bit fragile - I dropped it at airport security once and the back plate came off, but it's been tough enough, otherwise. If you are abusive, the lens will scratch. The case has held up fairly well - various nicks, scratches and scuffs are visible after five years, but only if you look closely. I recommend that you take the watch off when moving furniture, washing dishes, playing sports, etc. like an adult with common sense.

I replaced the battery once, but I accidentally lost one of the tiny winding knob parts, so be careful when you open the watch. My watch still works, but I can't adjust the time or date. If you try to adjust the time by moving the hands, be careful not to scratch the paint on the numerals - the white paint will come off easily.

Also, the Indiglo light is decent, but a bit hard to read in the dark because the hour and minute hands are slim.

The leather strap is attractive, comfortable and easy to replace. They tend to last about a year for me - your mileage may vary. Generic replacements are about $10-20 at most watch or department stores.

"I spontaneously ordered this watch after spending several months researching different brands. I was looking for a classic style, somewhere between $100 - $300, and had checked out all the usual suspects: Bertucci, Hamilton, Tag, Skagen, Swiss Army, etc. I wanted something affordable, reliable, and durable; something versatile, that I could get a lot of wear out of. After a lot of time spent comparing and evaluating, I bought this on impulse, without a second thought. In terms of customer satisfaction and value, this is literally the best purchase I've ever made. It's a tenth of the price of its competitors, and after owning it for a week I'm convinced it's the most handsome watch I've ever seen. The proportions, fit, and finish are impeccable. Its styling cues are modern and sophisticated, with subtle nods to mid-century design here and there (the typeface, the notched rectangular field in the center). Additionally, Timex products are known for their quality/durability. Overall, it's a must-buy.
Minor drawbacks: Doesn't have the light-up feature of other Timex models in the same price range, and the band probably isn't the best quality in the world (though the walnut calfskin color is perfect).
Bottom line: It's thirty dollars. Buy two, save one for later, and it's still a great deal.",Buy this watch.,5.0,B0000TIIQE

"Wow, that guy from Boise sure has a lot of watch rage!  Most of what he/she says doesn't make sense and is not even accurate.  Anyway, I've had this watch for a little over a week now, and let me give you a quick review.
The upshot is, at first I found a lot to complain about, but after a week, it started to grow on me, and right now, I like it a lot, and everyone I show it to is impressed, although most don't think it's worth the price + subscription fee.  Anyway, I don't regret this purchase like I did with the T-Mobile Sidekick.
Pros:
- Lots of geek appeal with real-time information updates
- Changeable watch faces
- Can receive updates from Outlook Calendar
- Atomic clock auto-syncing
- ESPN channel coming at end of January
- 10-second white backlight at the touch of a button
- Alarm clock, chronograph (stop watch), timer, time zones
- FM radio frequency, so low power and potentially low chances of us getting tumors from wearing this
Cons:
- Kinda large, not for slim wrists
- Not particularly attractive physically
- No color
- Battery life can be an issue; I've recharged only once but it's only because I use the animations sparingly and turn off the radio at night
- The wrist band is hard to use and adjust (this is one thing the rage man from Boise got right)
- Update can be slow at times
- You need to set up a travel schedule to receive personalized information (i.e., Outlook appointments) when you travel, which is totally stupid, especially as the set-up page on the Web is a perfect example of stupid programming (but not unlike the typical Microsoft goofs) -- too complicated to explain here, let's just say it doesn't work the way it should.
- Coverage is not consistent, and only works in the U.S. and Canada
My initial impression was this deserved no more than 2 stars, as the watch was kinda ugly and all the information you get (weather, news headlines, up to 15 stock quotes, Outlook calendar, etc.) is nice to have but totally not necessary, especially for people like myself who sit in front of the Internet all day and half night.  Plus, set up was more confusing than warranted, and the battery life issue was a big turn off.
But there is just so much gadget-freak factor in this watch.  It's actually more useful than my Casio camera watch or some prototypes of communicator watches I've seen in Asia, because, at least for a guy, the size is acceptable, and there's something about getting real-time weather and stock quotes that just fascinate me.  The weather channel is especially impressive, especially on cold wintry days like these in New York.  Pressing the channel button to cycle through the various channels -- BTW there's also a special channel that automatically cycles through the channels for you -- has a certain magical power of its own, and I just love showing this off to friends and coworkers, and get lots of pleasure when people come into my office to ask ""oh what is like outside?"" or ""hey show me your watch again.""
Should you buy this?  It's very hard to say.  Luckily MSN Direct offers a free month if you sign up with the monthly plan.  Then if you like it, you can switch to the annual plan and save 50%.

While this first generation device isn't perfect, it's not bad.
Opening the box containing the Abacus Wrist Net Smart Watch for MSN Direct (there's a mouthful!), you'll find two small manuals, the watch, and a two-piece charger. The charger consists of a plug (thoughtfully made to fold flat) and a rather clunky charger with an ""arm"" that rotates into place to hold the watch. You just lay the watch onto the arm and it starts charging through induction - no charging port or contacts to get dirty!
You need to activate the watch through MSN Direct to get your news, and it's best to take the $59 one-year subscription rather than go with the $9.95 monthly plan. You will need a credit card to subscribe. Once you've entered your unique watch ID and personal information, you get to pick the type of content you want sent to your watch. At this time (1/7/04) the sports channel powered by ESPN isn't available, but it's supposed to be ready soon.
It takes about 10 minutes to get a confirmation message on the watch telling you everything's OK, and then it can take up to 12 hours for all of your info to show up.
There are five buttons on the device that are used to turn on the white backlight (rather uneven, I thought), change channels, and navigate (enter, next, and previous). The buttons seem a little spongy, but not too bad. The Abacus AU4000 isn't waterproof but will survive splashes. If you're used to very expensive thin watches you'll hate this, but anyone who likes clunky multifunction watches will love this. From a design standpoint, the $299 Suunto N3 sure looks a lot nicer, but functionally it doesn't do anything different than this watch.
A charge is supposed to last 2 - 3 days, and I think I may just put my watch on the charging arm every night when I go to bed. Heavy use of animated screens will drain the battery faster; like any first-generation electronic device, battery life is an issue.
So far I'm fairly impressed, and find the display to be clear and easy to read.

"Had the Fossil watch for over a week now and it has performed flawlesly. Short of a wrist PDA, this is the next best thing. The screen is extremely readable and the backlight is very bright. Yes, the watch needs to be charged, but unless you insist on wearing it 24/7 this shouldn't be a challenge. The charging stand is well-designed - no wires to attach to the watch - just sit the watch on the ergonomic stand and you're set. The MSN site is well-designed and there is a good selection of data sources. One nice feature is that the MSN service provides a local news channel. I've had lots of static zaps over the past week with no problems to the watch. The band takes a little getting used to, but is comfortable. Basically, it's just a fun watch, and if you like the geek factor - it's there - but not THAT geekie that you'll be mistaken for a Borg.

"I was going to get the Abacus version of the new MSN Direct watch, but I noticed that almost all the customer reviews of the Fossil versions complained of hardware problems, and none of the Suunto reviews did.
The Suunto is shockproof and waterproof, while the Fossil watches are not.  The battery life is 5-7 days instead of 2-4 days for the Fossil watches.  The antenna is integrated into the watch face, so it can't malfunction the way many complain that the Fossil watches do.  And the watch uses an ordinary buckle and a strap with holes in it, so there's no issues with having to get extra hardware to use to adjust the watch strap, as many complain they must do with the Fossil watches.
I think the Fossil watches look better, and, obviously, they are cheaper, but it is definitely worth the extra money to get something that you can rely upon, if you're going to buy it at all.
$299 in addition to $59 a year for service may seem like a lot for a watch, but I know lots of people who pay thousands of dollars for their watches, and those watches don't really do a whole lot.  If you were looking to spend $19.95 on your wrist watch, then this one isn't for you.  But if you want to spend a little money to get a nice watch, then there are a lot of much more expensive watches, but I don't know of any nicer ones.",Definitely get a Suunto instead.,2.0,B0001540G4
"I read all the reviews and thought this was going to be a scary ride. I decided to get the cheap version vs the Suunto as the technology is really new.
The first thing you have to do is to adjust the watch band, this is easily achieved by using a tiny screwdriver or thumb tack to pop the pin. I'm not sure it will size for everyone. The band looks and feels like something that would be OK 1000ft under water and yet the watch is hardly splash resistant.
The watch looks Ok on my arm, a little big but not too out of place. For a fairly big sized guy it passes , if you're a petite female it might look very out of place.
The watch activated and charged OK and began receiving its signal. I tried sending messages to myself, this has up to a 10 minute lag. I altered my content and found that it changed within half an hour.
I have found that it loses all signal when I'm using my wireless laptop. I put the laptop down and it regains itself.
Overall it works better than I hoped for given the rest of the reviews.

"Mine lasted six days before going dead. Not dead battery, it is fully charged, just a completely dead watch. Judging from the other postings, my experience was better than many.

Also, messaging didn't work inspite of painstaking efforts, showed every Outlook calendar item to 10:30pm Sunday January 25, strap extremely tricky to adjust and never feels comfortable, buttons too hard to press and don't always operate correctly, too big and dorky looking, etc..

"After purchasing a couple of different ""vintage"" models off of Ebay, one of them stopped working. I took the back off to discover it was made in China and not an authentic Hamilton after all. I then became curious about the second one and looked at that one as well and sure enough, made in China. I did some research and the ""Vietnam era"" Hamilton watches are particularly susceptible to forgeries. I stumbled upon this newly manufactured more retro style model that Hamilton still produces and it was only $100 more than I paid for the stupid crappy knock-off. The face is slightly larger than the older models which I like as the vintage models seem almost like children's size in today's market. The quality is superior and it is a genuine Swiss made watch. I love the ""manual"" movement as opposed to a quartz or automatic movement. I changed the band to a black one once I received it but the khaki band is very attractive as well. The photos on here make it appear almost pea green but it is not green at all. If you are in the market for a well made, vintage looking, military style watch, then I promise you will not be disappointed with this one. And it is about $100 less on Amazon than anywhere else I have seen it. I have since written off buying ""vintage"" watches off Ebay. I can usually find the higher end models locally for the same or less money. I can touch and see them up close and I have just been burned too many times by forgeries. Not bagging on Ebay, it is great for a lot of things but of the more than 20 watches I have purchased on there, 6 have been a total screw job and the rest I found locally afterwards for the same or less money. You don't ALWAYS get what you pay for but in the case of this Hamilton for $255, you get more than what you are paying for. ""*****""",Exceptional watch,5.0,B0001WO7GK

"I'm a big fan of not only Hamilton Khaki watches but any military style watch.  This is a simple mechanical (user wound) watch.  The dial is black and simple with high quality, highly visible hash marks and numbers.  The second hand has the discernible tell-tale hack of a mechanical movement.  The case is a dull phosphate non-reflective style finish that lends well to the military style and appearance.  The crown is largish which makes winding and setting time and date easy.

"Covering the following categories....with a scale of 1-5 rating for each.  The rating is not compared to ALL watches out there, but compared to what I feel it should be for this watch style and at this price point.

CASE: (5)This is 38mm, bead blasted.  This finish is quite nice, nicer than the Seiko SNZG15 in my opinion. The Seiko had more of a ""plastic"" low end look to it with the finish. The bead blasting on the Hamilton has a more refined feel to it....and it should.  It's also very thin at just a hair over 8mm.  The 50m H2O resistance is fine for the intended use.  I'm sure it would survive a swim, or a dunk....but with the rating, don't make a habit of it.  Under that solid back cover (which is nicely engraved), you'll find movement hidden under another dust cover...nice. There is a nice o-ring gasket in a grove on which the back cover screws down onto to tightly seal it.  There also appears to be a small o-ring for the crown as well.  It isn't a screw down crown, but not many field watches have this...and in a mechanical, I prefer it this way.

DIAL: (4.5) Very clear, easy to read, not too busy, plain actually and I like it that way for this style. It's function over style. The numerals are easy to read. The printing is done very crisply.  The simple Hamilton logo in their signature font is also pleasing.  This is listed as a black dial.  Please know that it is really a ""light black"" (aka. dark, dark gray).  I only notice it when it's sitting next to another watch with a deep black dial. Indices are very clear as well.

HANDS: (5) Love them!  The hour and minute hands are superb. The minute had touches out to almost the second indices.  The second hand is my favorite.  It's a bright easy to spot white with a nice lollipop counter balance.  It reaches out to the second indices easily and has a very smooth sweep for an ETA 2804-2.

LUME:  (3) Average for the indices.  Above average for the hands.  Note that the second had is fully lumed as well.  Overall, for a non-dive watch I can't complain too much.  This is one area I would like to see improved.  Ex. It would be nice if a small dot on the indices were not lumed; rather, it would be best for the numerals to be lumed as well as the hands.

MOVEMENT: (4.5) ETA 2804-2 mechanical reliability.  It winds easily and smoothly.  There is NO excuse to overwind this watch.  You can easily feel it tighten a bit towards the end of the full spring tension....then it will hit a wall (if you are going slow and easy, you can hit it if you want). When you feel it, stop....remember go slow, as you should with any wind. I've had this watch for about a week and it will continue to break in and get better with accuracy and should with power reserve as well.  Power reserver, I've had 42 hours and 35 hours so far on intentional depletions.  For this price point and movement, this is what I expected.

**UPDATED** Sept 2017: ACCURACY: (2) This watch, like all ETA movements I've had is easily regulated by the owner if you are willing to do so (I haven't done it and don't really want to though). The watch comes adjusted from Hamilton, likely in only 1-2 positions and the regulation is set at neutral. Out of the box, it ran about 10 seconds fast per day.  After a few days, it was down to 7 consistently.  **UPDATE** Over the past month it's now around +/- 17-20 seconds per day.  I consider this ""acceptable"" but not ideal or ""good"".  I'll probably need to regulate this one myself.

OVERALL FIT & FINISH: (5) For a thin field watch, mechanical, it feels great. The domed sapphire crystal is a nice touch (dome). There is nothing on this little gem that feels cheap in anyway.  I had it side by side with the Seiko SNZG15 and there is no comparison in fit and finish, the Hamilton wins for me.

FEEL ON THE WRIST: (5) Superb.  The lug to lug distance helps this 38mm watch feel more like a 40mm. It doesn't feel too small at all.  I thought this would be an alternative to my favorite 40mm dive watch; but it is slowly becoming my daily watch at this point.  It feels that good.

STRAPS/BANDS: (4) The stap is comes with is a nice leather-lined canvas strap that does break in well and is comfortable.  The hardware is also solid and bears the Hamilton logo.  The color, while a personal choice, is one I'm not fond of.  I would have preferred the black face come with the olive strap.  Oh, well.  OEM strap = 3. However, this watch is a ""strap monster"" and looks great with leather and NATO (rating of 5!).

VALUE: (5) For sub-$300 (should find in the $230-260 range) gray market Swiss made watch from a highly respected Swiss holding company (part of the Swatch Group, the same as Omega, Breguet, Blancpain, Longines, Tissot, etc.), you can't really go wrong here. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
NEGATIVES:

OVERAL RECOMMENDATION: (43/50 points = 86% = 4 stars, a grade of ""B"") If you are looking for a SWISS MADE, affordable, solid field watch...this is a good choice.  Yours will probably be more accurate...I hope.","Great value for Swiss mechanical, solid choice",4.0,B0001WO7GK

"I bought this watch for a new job and have been wearing it everyday for about 6 weeks. I wanted something understated but professional, and this watch delivered. I am not a flashy person, and do not like to draw attention to myself. I wanted a professional looking watch to upgrade from my Casio illuminator (which is a great watch btw) but was still reliable and functional.
This watch has been a perfect fit for me. I swapped the band out for a black canvas strap (not a nato) to match the face. I think the sand color strap it comes with doesn't go with a business casual wardrobe as much. With the new strap, I can wear this for all occasions, which I do.
Accuracy has been great, better than an automatic for sure. I have reset the time each week and have tracked the accuracy below:

- Week 3 - +51 secs
- Week 4 - +53 secs
- Week 5 - +60 secs
- Week 6 - +48 sec

I was nervous about wearing a watch you have to wind, but I find myself winding it throughout the day.

"I have nothing negative to say about the Hamilton Khaki series of watches. This model (H69419933) is a quality field watch and unbeatable at this price point! A beautiful, slightly domed sapphire crystal an ETA 2836-2 manual wind movement within a simple yet high quality matte finished 38mm SS case! The non-screw down crown is signed and slightly oversized for easy setting and winding. The face is a rich black or ""army"" green depending on which model you choose (I bought both after seeing how nice the first one was). It also has basic illumination, just enough to read in the dark, but not so much that it lights up like a Christmas tree. In any event, I was a bit concerned about the case size being slightly small on my small to medium sized wrist, but it appears bigger to me than others claiming to be 38mm and is absolutely perfect for my liking. It's definitely not a ""monster"" size, as is the current trend, but it's also in no way ""dainty"" on my wrist either. Larger than a Seiko 5 model, which I believe are measured at 38mm?? and a bit smaller and a lot thinner than a Rolex GMT Master II at 42mm. Like I said, perfect for my taste! Finally, I was also a bit concerned about the strap, but it is much nicer than I thought and the buckle is signed as well. I did change them both out for NATO's, as I have a variety of colors and can change the look in an instant. Lastly, the ""sweep"" second hand is long illuminated and sleek and ""sweeps"" along smoothly, as only a manual or automatic movement can. For a casual yet classy, simple yet very nicely finished watch that you could wear pretty much anywhere, you cannot go wrong with the Hamilton Khaki line of watches! Highly recommended!

"Hamilton is a historic brand that has manufactured watches that truly stand the test of time. The simplicity and beauty of the khaki field manual wind watch is stunning. After owning several different watches with a variety of different movements and specs I have finally found a watch that sticks to the core of watch manufacturing and design. This really is a timeless watch (no pun intended). There are no thrills or bells and whistles when it come to this watch. It's just a great piece that tells time and looks fantastic while doing it. I have splurged on field watches in the past with all the alarms, altimeters, tachometers, and chronographs one could handle and found that I never used or needed anything more than a time keeper. If you are looking for something simple yet elegant with a bit of ruggedness and at a fairly good price point, then trust in this watch. I was a bit hesitant about purchasing a watch with a manual movement but have found that winding this watch on a daily basis has given me a more personal connection to it. It is not labor some task, but more of a reminder of how simply and eloquently the watch works. It will never need a battery, can withstand any electromagnetic pulse, and it feels and looks great. The band is reinforced with a comfortable leather lining and metal grommets to protect the band holes. The watch reads fairly well at night, although with the thinner hands it can sometimes be hard to read in darker conditions. As long as there is some ambient light you should be fine. Sapphire crystal is the best of the best as far as watch faces go so I have no concerns about scratches or chips. The color of the band makes this watch great for practically any attire. You can find Hamilton leather bands for fairly cheap online if you feel like the khaki strap is too casual. Overall, I couldn't be happier and I've been very impressed with Hamilton's manufacturing.

"Update: March 30
I've added a star.  I've grown to Love this watch.  After about a week, it began to hold a charge for over 24 hours.  The band has softened up and is very comfortable.  My comment about the Lume still stands but I do really like this watch!  I would recommend it.
------------------------------
I have had this watch about a week now and my initial thoughts are; it's just ok.  Certainly not bad, certainly not great.

The weight and size are nice.  You know it's there but it isn't too heavy. It's easy to read, without superfluous dial markings.  The bead blast finish is nice for a field watch in that it won't show scratches easily after a day of hunting or fishing.  The band is a little stiff out of the box but breaks in nicely once worn a few times, although I have my doubts about it holding up to rigorous activity.  It seems the weave pattern will pick easily and any sweat may deteriorate the leather lining over time.

The Lume on the face is basically non-existent.  Under normal lighting conditions, it's undetectable after dark.  I did hit it with a flashlight and got decent reflectiveness for a short time but don't count on being able to read this watch if caught out after nightfall.

As for holding a charge after winding - this timepiece (or at least the one I received) is very lacking.  It holds a charge for about 12 hours.  I'm having to wind it twice a day on the 7's.  Not what I expected at all but it's ok I guess.

If you take this watch for what it was meant to be - a field watch - it's OK. In my opinion, a little expensive for what you get but overall I'm satisfied with the purchase.",It's better than OK.....,4.0,B0001WO7GK
"Traditional windups have many advantages,this watch sets the bar~Excellent!!! I have 25 years as a watch nut,have many(none are quartz).
First there is no glass back-a big plus in anti-magnetic defense,in addition,this watch has a second soft iron cover inside,(same as my Speedmaster)for additional protection. Wind ups are more consistant with accuracy.(mine is +2 seconds a day).They are much thinner than autos.
  This watch has a domed sapphire crystal,scratched only by a diamond....

"Beautiful, simple watch. Extremely legible dial (though lume is so-so). Love the ten-second routine of winding it in the morning. You can't get more analog than thisa welcome change from the wired world.

Still getting used to the bead blast. It's a bit rougher than I'm used to (e.g., Seiko SNZG15 or aftermarket bead blasts). But I suppose that this will be more resistant to scratching.

The sapphire crystal is ever-so-slightly domed. Classy.

Thinner and lighter than a typical automatic due to no rotor. Here are some cool details from ETA on the movement:[...] per day, people!

Wears larger than 38mm due to long lugs. I usually wear 42mm-ish watches and it doesn't feel small to me. Begs to be worn on a Zulu or NATO strap, mainly because I don't want to see my wrist in the longish gap between the case and the spring bars. (The other benefit of the Zulu/NATO being that the watch stays attached to the strap if one of the spring bars fails.)

Accuracy is so-so, so far, but not going to worry about it yet because it's still new.

9/18/2016 UPDATE:

I ended up selling this watch and keeping my Seiko SNZG15 auto, which I picked up for just over $100. It was quite a bit more accurate (all my Seiko 5s were more accurate than this much more expensive Hamilton). I prefer the lighter matte finish on the G15 vs. the finish on the Hamilton, which was a bit grainier. The date was not centered in the date window, which was irritating. The sapphire has no anti-glare coating, so was hard to read at times. Too much space between the case and the spring bars (i.e., lugs feel a bit too long). SNZ is also 100m water resistant and has both day/date complication. And something nice about the fact that Seiko makes every single component in their watches. I simply think the Seiko 5s are a better value.",Beautiful and simple watch,4.0,B0001WO7GK

I really wanted to like this watch -- and the other Hamilton I purchased after this one suddenly stopped working -- but these watches are not your father's Hamilton. This watch stopped working after perhaps 6 months of very light usage. The internal mechanisms are clearly third rate. The craftsmanship is totally lacking. It was hard to find someone willing to make a repair that didn't exceed the price of the watch. I replaced the watch with another Hamilton (Hamilton Men's HML-H70455533 Khaki Field Black Dial Watch) -- it has also totally failed.

"The Hamilton Khaki Field is a very simple watch.  Simple dial, simple strap and a simple hand wind movement.  Field watches are meant to be tools and this is no exception.

The Khaki Field's dial has both 12 and 24 hour arabic numerals and is very easy to read.  Even though the sapphire crystal on the front of the watch is domed, it is very easy to read at all but the most extreme angles (this is not the case with all watches).  The date window is even easily legible when the minute hand covers the 3 position.

As far as construction is concerned, the watch is very well made.  There are not many options for mechanical, handwind, swiss watches for $200-$300.  The Khaki Field's case feels solid and the crown winds and sets the time very smoothly, much more smoothly than most automatics I've owned.  Provided is a very simple khaki colored strap that is lined with leather.  The strap is pretty uncomfortable out of the box, but after a week it becomes much less stiff and is very comfortable to wear.  It looks nice, has some Hamilton branding on the clasp and the sizing holes are even grommeted to reduce fraying.  I originally had the watch on a NATO strap, but since breaking in the provided canvas strap I have found it more comfortable and nicer looking.  Should you not like the strap, it is easy to swap out.

The Khaki Field is also a very small watch.  It's case is 39mm with 20mm lugs.  One of my favorite things about this watch is it's weight and size.  It's case is very light and only 8mm thick.  This means that it fits under shirt cuffs and coat cuffs without riding up on your wrist, or digging into the top of your hand.

If you are a looking for an affordable watch to wear everyday, and you aren't a stock broker, than this will fit most people's needs.  It's comfortable, easy to read and built to last.  The watch looks quite plain, but field watches are made to be simple tools to tell the time and nothing more.

"I was looking for a reliable yet inexpensive watch. I settled on the 3 Casio watches that look like this and chose this one of the three. There's the white faced, the black faced, and this one is the yellow faced w/24 hour numbering. (some pictures of this are over exposed. The face is what I'd call a yellowish wheat color. Quite nice.)  All three likely have the same internal mechanism.  My watch was unexpectedly light in weight which is a huge bonus in my book.

The band was cheap as hell, but I chose the ""Watch Band Genuine Leather 16mm Black Classical Vegetable oil treated durable double stitched and padded with gold plated buckle"" sold by Watchmaterial here on Amazon. Now I have a nice watch that looks like $1-200 bucks, and I'm out $20.

So, buy one of these el cheapo Casio watches, buy a 16mm (width) watch band to replace the really cheap band Casio sells with these, and you'll look like $1-200 also. Plus, if you damage it or drop it in the toilet, just spend another $10. I'm considering buying the black one next. I might like that better. My educated guess is that I'll get 5 years out of this one and will likely retire it when the cheap crystal gets too scratched.

I give this product Three Thumbs Up!!!

3-14-12 -- Edit to add:

This watch keeps virtually perfect time. Only my cell phone, ipod, and my computer, which are all synched constantly, do a better job. It's within seconds of the computer time when I adjust it twice a year for the time changes. The ""crystal"" is becoming moderately scratched so I thought I'd buy another watch. Quite likely yours will suffer premature battery failure as mine did, but it's pretty inexpensive to buy 2 watch batteries on Amazon for a couple of bucks. When I buy my second watch I'll probably just put that second fresh battery in it and it should be good for 3+ years.

"I recently got this watch and wanted to respond to the other review that said this watch was the size of a women's watch.  It's not.  Granted it is not as large as some other men's watches out there today, but to me watches have gotten ridiculously large. It's like having a hockey puck attached to your wrist.  This watch is basically the same size as every other ""field"" watch I've ever had, and I've had many, including those from LL Bean, Victorinox and Wenger.
My only complaint about the watch is that the ticking is fairly loud.  Otherwise it's fine, especially for $40.

I can't tell you what in particular I had against Timex, but there you have it, I was a watch snob. Since I was late for everything and driving people crazy asking them the time, I finally had to buy one for daily wear.
This inexpensive, nondescript little watch has turned out to be one of my better buying decisions. It withstands a ton of physical abuse just from things like  bathing the dog, doing laundry and  spilling coffee all over it. It really is an amazingly durable watch for the price.  I swear the face has not a single scratch..and I NEVER take it off.
I especially like the way it lights up when i depress the bezel. Discreet, but bright enough that I can easily see the time. It does say unisex but I personally think it would look a bit small on a mans wrist. The face size is somewhere around the size of a quarter.

So far, the band has held up well but I don't punish it too much. Those who are tougher on their watch bands may have other requirements.

"I love the Timex Expedition series of ""field watches"".  They are rugged and heavy, which I need because I am rather big and clumbsy at times. I can ruin a cheap watch in 24 hours, just by bumping into walls, furniture, the washing machine or door handles.  I usually scratch the lens or knock the watch off my wrist.  Worse, I have had a lot of trouble with undersized leather bands that are too stiff to fit correctly and too short to wear property, even in this Timex series.

So, I prefer these watches, which look like diving watches, but they are not.  The are sufficiently water proof to be used in a harsh environments, to wash your car, dishes, etc, without any worry. I would not recommend showering with the watch and definitely not use in a hot tub (they will cloud up under a lot of hot water).  But, for daily use, use at work, in the shop, and outdoor, it's a great watch, affordable, and it has the day and the date displayed in large letters and numbers.  The Indiglo feature backlights the watch by pressing the stem, which is protected with heavy metal shoulders.  (too bad, because previous watches were not so protected and I could easily light my watch by flexing hand back.  not possible with this design).

I preferred the alarm version of this watch, which I've been using for 20 years, but they stopped making it.  This was my second choice, primarily because of the similar features, the large simple dial, and the stainless steel watch band (larger than I needed - I had to remove 3 links to get it to fi me - a good thing!)  This watchband is stronger thank others I have owned - better design.  Find videos on-line about how to remove and replace the links. It's not difficult, if you have a very fine hardened steel pin or very fine screw driver for eye glasses (the black kind).  Pins are hard to drive out, but easy to use once you get them 1/8th of an inch out.","Good, comfortable, everyday watch. Great features, large, well made wrist band.",5.0,B00020J14E

"This is my third Data Link watch.  The first one was one of the original metal models that read downloaded data through the CRT.  Overall, I liked that one especially the glass crystal and what was then a new concept.  However, it was much heavier and the metal around the edges of the case eventually wore to a rough finish and buttons broke. The second one was similar to this one except with the resin band.  The second model was purchased at Wal-Mart.  It did not last nearly as long as the first one.  The resin band cracked, a screw fell out of the face and it quit lighting up for dark viewing.  So far, I like this third one.  It was a bit difficult to take links out to adjust the expansion band.  However, after a couple of links were removed, I like it much better than the resin band model and I paid less than what I had paid at Wal-Mart.  While I like the watches features, it does not completely replace a PDA.  It does however hold contact information that I can have with me in circumstances when I would not carry a PDA (swimming, etc.)  I like this watch.",Good watch,4.0,B00020J1G2
"I wanted a watch that could be more than a watch. In this case I was attracted by PDA features. As a long time user of Palm and Pocket PC I have expected something similar to them. I didn't get much.

I have no use for ""Iron Man"" features - memory of 200 laps? several count-down counters? Default PGA schedule?

Software came up and saw the watch and even imported contacts and notes from Outlook. It had dicovered certain duplicates in schedule and when I took care of them - didn't load them in at all any more. Unlike Palm or Pocket, the changes you make on your watch won't be written back. The WORST thing - the watch is not workable as Contact or Notes reader. You get only a 2-line display, one gets taken over by note's name, other scrolls very slowly through your note. You can't go back. you can pause but not move the note back or scroll to more important part. If you have 10 contacts with 1 phone number each, I guess it could work for you. If each of your 50 contacts has a fax, cell and ..... getting thought the clutter is hard. I'm thinking about giving ""Fossil Abacus AU5005 Wrist PDA with Palm OS"" a try.",don't use as a PDA,3.0,B00020J1G2
"I've had this watch several months now, and like it very much. I used to wear the Data Link model that read data off the computer screen, but they don't work with LCD monitors, and the accessory that allows use with LCDs is no longer available. The buttons on that watch had developed contact bounce so bad that it was nearly impossible to use anyway, so it was time for a change.

My only complaints so far with this watch are that the tiny shaft encoder that's operated by the stem, to scroll through menus and enter data, is rather touchy. It skips frequently, forcing you to rotate the stem back to the choice you wanted. Also, the stem clicks as you turn it, but the detents don't necessarily occur coincident to the selections. In other words, it takes some fiddling to enter data. But it's not that bad, and pretty amazing that they could fit an encoder in there at all. It's fine as long as it doesn't get worse with use, because entering data can take a lot of stem rotation.

And I wish Timex would use a crystal face instead of plastic, because it doesn't take long for it to get scuffed and scratched, no matter how careful you are.

But other than those small complaints, the watch is a joy to use, the software and cable work perfectly, and the features and flexibility are bound to make your life easier.

Edit: After a year or so, the shaft encoder has become somewhat worse, sometimes skipping a dozen or more letters in a single click of the stem. Rather frustrating to use, but eventually I can get to the data I'm after. Also, while simply standing still the other day, I heard a ping as the metal front of the watch simply popped off and landed at my feet, leaving two little grounding springs poking out. I scraped the old glue off with an x-acto knife, carefully applied some epoxy, and glued it back on. Seems to me they could do better in that regard too.",Very useful features,5.0,B00020J1G2
"My first watch I ever bought was a timex digital with flexible band and thin top. It lasted 25 years till a spring wore out on the button that you push to find out the date. So it was time to replace it. Unfortunetly nowadays all the watches are big and bulky and/or non-digital. This is the flattest digital watch that i could find that was a Timex as well. What I don't understand is if technology is making everything smaller, why watches are only getting bigger?! Features haven't changed much from my old watch to this one except the functions are opposite each other and a little more difficult to program. At first I thought it was because I wasn't use to it but after comparison, it is a little harder to program.

Pros: flattest digital Timex available, visible date and time, indiglo makes it easy to see when button pushed, expanding band allows easy on and off and adjusts as arms strengthen or weaken muscle wise, water resistant.

Cons: very small day of week, easy to accidently set chime on the hour by bumping a button, bulkier than older watches, harder to see time due to indiglo coating on face, bulkier face allows scratches faster and a few other minor issues.

all in all: technology seems to have made a worse watch over time but at least it still works like a timex and is the flattest out there now. That is why I gave it five stars.

I highly recommend this seller as they did send an extra battery with the watch. Worth the extra forty five cents. And fast delivery too!",Takes a lickin and keeps on tickin,5.0,B00020J1BC

"A classic style, with classic lines and curves, and leather to band it all underside enlivens time as if it were the first sun rising. Timex brings in this watch what time once was: a simple and pure marking of moment to moment.

This watch has no internet connection. It has no date feature. Triathlons and moontrips are not recommended while wearing this watch. But this watch, in giving you time, will bring you the world.

Wear this watch with your best suit, with a sharp white shirt and, if the weather is chilly, wear a plain plaid wool scarf. With a silver-hued frame and rich black leather strap, you will notice heads turning, wishing they wore this fundamental accessory. Traditional ensembles are timeless, and will lift you above the less dapper, less dashing dancers at the dinner ball.

When she sees you, that love of your life yet unmet, know what time it is. She'll want to know, and you will be prepared. As you provide the time, she'll provide her name. Always know the time, and you'll always know her name. Forget the time, and she may leave without notice.

Take her hand with your right hand. Your watch is worn on the left. The Easy Reader model has large digits, and only takes a glance to know how long you have for the ferry, for the sunset, and for the moon to rise. Your love will grow without hurry.

If things get late, have no worry. Indiglo lighting will illuminate the face with a swift press of the button.

If, by owning and wearing an Easy Reader Timex watch, you are able to share with her your time, know that when tomorrow comes, she'll give you the time of day.

"It's amazing how hard it is to find a watch that just tells the time without any extraneous complications on it.  I don't need to be told the day or date or the phases of the moon;  I just want to know the time.  This is basic, handsome, easy to read (gee, I guess that's why it's called an Easy Reader!), accurate, and it's a Timex.  I've had Timex watches for decades, and they always run perfectly until I lose them.  When I manage to lose this  which I will, because there's some kind of weird Watch-Losing Jinx hanging over my head  I will get another one.","You can keep your $10,000 watches;  I'd rather have this.",5.0,B0002LYEJK

Too tight for myself to be comfortable with. So if you're buying this for a Man, or woman, keep in mind if they have a larger wrist, this may be a bit snug fitting for them.

"Product review - I got my Seiko Titanium a week back from Amazon, I love this watch, I will just add to what others have said already - it's a lightweight and well crafted timepiece. Any brick watch store will charge you over $200 on this watch, so price ($105) is the other plus on this watch. The watch manual could have been little better but not an issue, it's simple to use.

Shopping experience - I like shopping on Amazon.com, particularly their recommendations on the customer taste based on one'e browsing history, i.e. customers who saw this item bought this...

Initially I started out and wanted to buy a Swiss watch - they are so well designed and they stand out, but while browsing around found Seiko watches equally attractive, better priced overall Japanese watches like cars offer better value.

If you like chrono watches - you should check out Casio Edifice and Duros - they are even cheaper and very sleek looking watches. I also notice the Seiko's and Casio's Asian/European watch collections are better than American collection  - So check out Ebay as well before buying it on Amazon.com",Seiko Titanium - SNA139 - Great watch,4.0,B00068TJLC
"Shipping was FAST!  I received the watch a little over 24 hours after I ordered it!

The titanium watch is extremely light, easy to read, very good looking, and has all the features of my other Seiko watch which was much more expensive!

"I just got the watch today from amazon & I'm just amazed. The build quality of the watch is great along with the nice touch of titanium finish on the watch. This piece does not have the shine some other watches have, which is how I like my watches. Since its titanium, the weight of the timepiece is extremely light compared to that of stainless steel.

"I just received my watch today and I have to say, it's an unbelievable deal. The quality of this timepiece is amazing. I've never owned a titanium watch so I just wanted to emphasize how much lighter it is on my hand compared to stainless-steel. I've noticed negative comments regarding the alarm on the watch. True, it can only be set 12 hours ahead and the sound is not that loud. However, I must emphasize that the alarm can also be used as a countdown timer or secondary time zone keeper. If you really need a loud alarm that you don't have to reset daily, go to your local store and buy a real alarm clock. If you are like me and need something every now and then when you travel, than this simple alarm is more than adequate. To sum it all up, the precision and quality are amazing and the timepiece is beautiful to look at.

Otherwise...great watch!","High Quality Watch, Great Price!",5.0,B00068TJLC
"As a watch hound, I fell in love with this watch at first sight. The matte finish of the titanium case and band combined with the white on black dial made for a very appealing package. When I put it on, the deal was sealed. The light weight and smooth finish of the band said - you can wear this all day in comfort. Titanium is a miracle metal - it doesn't rust, it's tough, it's hypo-allergenic, it's amazingly light and it looks cool.

The watch keeps very good time. The chronograph feature is simple to use - by that I mean, it's intuitive so no manual is required. The alarm function is another matter. Crack the book or you're going to be frustrated. Like some of their other alarm watches, the value of this feature is limited. If you get up every day at 6:00 AM, you have to set the alarm every day.  Silly idea.

"I have had this watch for a week now and like it.  It is attractive, easy to read and, as others have noted, it is light.

I am in my 50s and probably have some hearing loss but I am no where near needing a hearing aid.  The alarm is my only complaint.  Everything else has met or exceeded my expectations.  And the price is very good for what you get.

FOLLOW-UP:  Several days after receiving the watch and writing the review, it stopped running!  I've had a Seiko watch that ran flawlessly for 10 years so I didn't expect this.  I had to send it to the service department (at my expense) and weight three weeks.

- Locking clasp and bracelet are well designed and look like they will hold up for years to come.

- Chronograph is easy to use and read

- Waterproof feature works well too.

- Keeps accurate time

Minor negatives are as follows,

- Alarm is rather soft. Wish it was slightly louder.

- Alarm is difficult to set properly. Took me a bit of time and practice to figure out how to set it correctly. The manual was not much help with that.

- The crystal has a slight dome to it, and it is raised above the outer bezel, so you have to be careful not to bang the watch against anything while wearing it. I've been wearing mine for about 2 months, and it has a small (almost imperceptable) scratch on the face. The design would be nicer if the crystal was flat and the bezel was raised to protect it a little.

"As everyone else noted in their reviews, the Titanium body and band make this a very light weight watch for its size.  The 40mm case is a good size for smaller wrists, although I had to remove three links from the band.

The chronograph feature works well and can do splits, but it means that the large second hand does not tell time.  There is a separate, tiny subdial that shows a 1 Hz second hand.  I wish the main dial would also serve as a 5 Hz second hand in other than chronograph mode.  For the reviewers complaining about the dial alignment -- it is adjustable in the time-setting mode.  The manual explains it poorly, but you can adjust the offset of the minute and second hands.

The alarm is much too quite to wake me and requires daily setting; instead I use the alarm subdial as a second timezone to display GMT.",Great value in mens watches,4.0,B00068TJLC
"The watch is great, the alarm is a bit soft, but as said above the value is great etc...

I did NOT like the titanium band. Its NOT solid links, rather a solid link, bound by 2 bands of titanium to the next one.

Incredibly, I was able to use an old band I had from a St. Moritz titanium watch i had. It fit in exactly! and looks the same, just its all solid.","Watch is great, bracelet less so",4.0,B00068TJLC
"For about $100, this is an excellent watch.  The band and case are well made, even compared to $300-400 watches.  The face and (very slightly) curved crystal are handsome and not too dressy.  However, the ""Hardlex"" crystal material is not exceptionally hard.  It's too bad Seiko (apparently) doesn't offer titanium watches with sapphire faces.  ""Sapphire"" (mineral name: corundum, chemical formula: Al2O3) has a hardness of 9 on a scale of 1 to 10, where diamond is 10.  My watch crystal picked up scratches on the first day of wearing it.  The hardest common material that could have done the scratching is quartz, with a hardness of 7, making me suspect the ""Hardlex"" is just some type of doped quartz.  However, after almost 2 weeks of wear the face has only one scratch, and I'm rough on my watch, always hitting it against things and putting it in my pocket with keys and change.

The watch is not particularly lightweight if you're used to plastic- or leather-banded timepieces.  I tried a few other Ti Seikos at department stores and they were much lighter and thinner.  Several times a day I notice the second hand has stopped because the second timer button hits something (my wrist?).  However, a few positive surprises: the main second hand moves several times per second, giving it the look of near-continuous movement.  The glow-in-the-dark hands seem quite bright.  Sometimes I notice the glow, even just in a dim room.

Highly recommended for a $100 watch that can pass off as a $300 watch.  If you can't handle scratches, go for a heavier (and pricier) sapphire crystal watch.","Not as light as expected, Hardlex only moderately hard.",4.0,B00068TJLC
"This is the exact same as the Seiko SKX173, but that one has a black face, not yellow, and usually sells for $10-$12 less.

Like virtually all automatic Seiko watches with the common ""7S26"" components, the watch keeps very acceptable time, perhaps drifting by a few seconds +/- per day.

The watch will run down if not worn for 40+ hours. Not wearing the watch an average of 8 hours/day or not storing it flat on its back can also cause more drift in accuracy than usual.

It's also not possible to stop the second hand when setting the running watch to ensure time is perfectly accurate down to the second -- this can be done with battery-operated Seiko diver watches.

Check out the battery-operated, quartz-movement Seiko divers if virtually perfect timekeeping is needed and a watch won't be regularly worn. Battery replacement / 200m waterproofing can run pricey on those when needed, however. (It should be noted that Seiko recommends standard checks/maintenance on the automatics every 2 years or so, and similar pricey waterproofing concerns could be encountered there, too.)

If a watch is worn regularly/daily and timekeeping within a minute is generally acceptable (and someone wants to test their luck with being one of those who can reportedly go into the decades with a watch being just fine without battery replacement / new waterproofing), the classic automatic Seiko divers like this do the job just fine.

Hopefully someday Seiko explores their own solar line of watches once again. For the time being, those seem to have become their Pulsar line of diver watches, which supposedly can last 180 days on a single charge....","Very nice, but keep in mind....",5.0,B00068TJ44
"I bought this watch several months ago and have been pleased with it since.  It is quality as opposed to those watches you pay less for.  One would naturally expect that but in this day and age paying more does not always equal more quality, but in this case it definitely does.  The watch is heavy, and the strap is long enough for most any size wrist (no skimping on strap length) and rugged.  In fact, this watch is probably made to wear underwater outside the wet/dry suit but it looks great above water in everyday life!

"A Seiko 6117-6400, given to me by my uncle who'd just returned from Viet Nam, was my gateway drug into the addictive world of watches. Maybe it was the size and heft of that first watch that predisposed me to versatile and functional work watches ever since. I have been wanting a bright yellow-faced watch for years, but until this purchase, had not pulled the trigger. All of my other watches are much more subdued - this one is like a fishing lure. When I spotted it on Gear Patrol at a great deal for Amazon Prime Day, I simply couldn't resist any longer and hit the buttons and it was on its way.

When it arrived, I opened the shipping box and spotted the US-Seiko cardboard presentation box and inside, the watch was strapped around a nice, plump pillow. I slipped it off, unbuckled it and slapped it on my wrist.  I thought that it would have more weight to it as it felt lighter than my daily-wear Luminox 6250.  The black polyurethane strap felt thinner and more plastic rather rubber as I latched the buckle.  I tried the rotating bezel and it seemed to move very smoothly and indexed nicely with a pleasant clicking as it rotated. Maybe it moves too easily as I've found it inadvertently moved over a few notches after a day or two of wear. My impression was that the bezel itself has a sharper presentation at the edge where it recesses for the numbers and markings. Furthermore, I prefer and the markings to be either cast proud or engraved into the bezel rather than the printed on style Seiko chose. The luminescent hands and dial markers are quite bright, but I feel that a black outline would have been more distinctive and made for easier reading than the chrome outline. The date and time adjust easily in typical Seiko fashion. I expect it will be as tough as nails as most Seiko watches of this series are.

I was a bit dismayed to see Mov't Malaysia on the dial and China on the strap. From what I understand, the movement is made in Malaysia then shipped to Seiko's plant in Hong Kong / China for assembly. I prefer my Seiko watches to Japanese proper.

"I both love and hate the Seiko SGF709 watch.

It is my first dress watch in lieu of my ugly duckling, Casio DB360-1AV, which is both accurate and functional, with a 30 page data book (handy for telephone #s and passwords) and 5 alarms (speaker included) useful for future appointments (birthdays, meetings, doctor's appointments 6 months down the line, etc.).

Whereas the Casio is ugly but function, this Seiko is gorgeous- in an understated way- but it is also primitive, with just a day-date display, and second, minute and hour hands. The SGF709 is thin, keeps accurate time (within a second in the month and a half I've had it), weighs very little (thanks to the Titanium), and has a scratch resistant crystal.

However, the second hand does not line up on the tick marks as an earlier post indicated. Actually the second hand varies making it difficult to distinguish time when it is between seconds sometime and near a tick mark thirty seconds later. This last item is one of the basic functions of a dress watch and speaks to quality issues at Seiko; the second hand on an old Seiko of my fathers lines up perfectly.

The above problem irritates me but I'm unwilling to send it back for repair. Now I think of the erratic second hand as a reminder to do better quality work in all of my work. Still, I just wish some watch manufacturer made a quality watch dress watch with more useful features that would for the most part eliminate the necessity of carrying around a PDA.",SGF709 - Nice Look but Seiko has Quality Issues,3.0,B00068TK7U
"Basically, I was looking for lightweight titanium day/date watch. Seiko is probably (or at least as far I was searching) practically only brand that has these parameters in this price range.

Got a good deal, free shipping (otherwise DHL costs around 30-40$ to Finland). The minus was that Finland's customs, thanks to EU, slammed me 46,01 customs tax bill :( It still costed with taxes for me about 181 compared to Finland's prices: cheaper versions like SGG709 cost here 189-219 and this SGF709 would have costed even more.

"we all know about this diver...the classic ultra durable seiko diver with a design going back to the 60s. we also know that while the quality is par excellence, they can sell these for just over $200because the movement has no hacking or manual winding.

for those of us who love the unbeatable durability, design and quality, those drawbacks are more badges of courage & love for this piece than drawbacks. many of us have these and seen them keep an accuracy better than swiss certified chronometer, which includes that famous swiss brand known for their submariner model. i've had those wonderful watches, and my seiko divers always matched or excelled their accuracy.

but neither here nor there. i don't desire to sell you on this particular seiko diver as it is clear i and many think it is a classic on par with the best and most expensive watches in the world.

the review is to note how i have a blue pepsi-cola version, an orange dial version, and wanted this yellow dial for a long time. strapping it on (i switched it to a black leather military bund strap), i didn't expect to adore it quite as much as i do. it is now my favorite of all my seiko divers of the same model case/movement. no, not just because it is new. it is stunning.

i will add that i scoured the net for the lowest price, and amazon was right there. this piece outperforms my expectations for style and beauty with that yellow dial. as for the rest of it, it is for those who can live with shaking rather than winding, and no hack feature (tho there is an informal hacking by slightly reversing the minute hand to stop the seconds hand, and then waiting to set when you synchronize with a time source).

if you can deal with the lack of a hack & winding, this is the purest, most beautiful & quality watch out there at any price, but certainly at a great price, even better on this website. and the yellow dial, is the best version of ANY diver to my taste.",BEST OF THE SEIKO DIVERS...YELLOW RULES!,5.0,B00068TJ44

The lume is great which is typical of Seiko divers (I own 3 of them). This movement runs around +8 seconds a day which is perfectly acceptable for this type of watch.

"This the second Seiko diver's watch I have owned, the first being a SKX781 ""Orange Monster"" that I have had for 12 years.  Somehow the Orange Monster stopped working so I sent it off to Seiko for a repair estimate and decided that the cost was too much for a 12 year old watch and started looking for a new one.  The yellow dial on this model caught my attention and the price was within my budget, so I decided to purchase the SKXA35 based upon the reviews and my own experience with Seiko through the years.

I received the watch in its nice blue box and with all of the accompanying documentation in fine shape.  The strap is definitely not like any other Seiko non metal straps I have had in the past as it is rather stiff and semi flexible in my opinion.  I started shaking it to get it started and to wind it and then strapped it on.  It fits my arm and wrist very comfortably and am very pleased with how it wears.  This watch is easily more accurate than my Orange Monster which always gained time and eventually would be six or seven minutes fast after several days.  Fortunately, the SKXA35 is much more accurate and is almost spot on for time after 5 days!  It has maybe gained 30 or 40 seconds as best as I can tell.  I guess I should have had the Orange Monster repaired but just dealt with it as it is an automatic.

Anyway, as others have said this is a great watch for the money and I am extremely pleased with it; the only real down side if any is the strap; it is too stiff for me, so I will probably get a different rubber strap eventually.  I like the rubber Seiko straps and will probably try one of those.  Fit and finish on this watch is spot on and what I would expect from Seiko; the chapter ring and unidirectional bezel are perfectly aligned, so no issues there.  The unidirectional bezel has a nice smooth feel and clicks very nicely.  If you are looking for a diver with a lot of bang for the buck, you can't go wrong with this.  I am looking forward to many years of use and enjoyment.  I also purchased this watch from Amazon because it came with the full three year warranty; hopefully I won't need it!",Watch is great; strap is stiff!,4.0,B00068TJ44

"I bought this watch in 1999 (Looked slightly different back then and was $450) and I still use it today because it still looks brand new.  When they say it's scratch resistant, they mean it.  For about 4 years I worked for a company assembling computers, and I would wear that watch and bang it all over the case of the computer, not one scratch came from it.  To this day, I have no visible scratches on the face and I wear it EVERY DAY.  The watch looks amazing (still has the best band I have ever seen) and I get compliments today on how nice it is.

Now for the minor problems:

It no longer holds a charge for 6 months when inactive, it's more like one week now.  That's ok because I always wear the watch.

The band clasp gets bent up after several months of use, but with a pair of pliers I can get it fixed again.

The calendar is practically useless because it runs off it's own ""mind"" and is always about 5-10 hours off.

Other than that, I still love it and I plan on wearing it for years down the road.",Great Watch,5.0,B00068TK8O

"This is the exact same as the Seiko SKXA35, but that one has a yellow face, not black, and sells for $10-$12 more.

Like virtually all automatic Seiko watches with the common ""7S26"" components, the watch keeps very acceptable time, perhaps drifting by a few seconds +/- per day.

The watch will run down if not worn for 40+ hours. Not wearing the watch an average of 8 hours/day or not storing it flat on its back can also cause more drift in accuracy than usual.

It's also not possible to stop the second hand when setting the running watch to ensure time is perfectly accurate down to the second -- this can be done with battery-operated Seiko diver watches.

Check out the battery-operated, quartz-movement Seiko divers if virtually perfect timekeeping is needed and a watch won't be regularly worn. Battery replacement / 200m waterproofing can run pricey on those when needed, however. (It should be noted that Seiko recommends standard checks/maintenance on the automatics every 2 years or so, and similar pricey waterproofing concerns could be encountered there, too.)

If a watch is worn regularly/daily and timekeeping within a minute is generally acceptable (and someone wants to test their luck with being one of those who can reportedly go into the decades with a watch being just fine without battery replacement / new waterproofing), the classic automatic Seiko divers like this do the job just fine.

Hopefully someday Seiko explores their own solar line of watches once again. For the time being, those seem to have become their Pulsar line of diver watches, which supposedly can last 180 days on a single charge....","Very nice, but keep in mind....",5.0,B00068TJ76

"I've been a fan of divers watches since college days. I first ran across a Seiko 150m model about 1988 and I've since come to regard this SKX173 200m as THE classic dive watch.  Not only is it great for water activities and sports, but it's also great for dry land functions such as telling time and looking cool.

The automatic mechanical power isn't just some outmoded watch technology from the past.  It's fascinating to have this intricate and accurate time-machine on your wrist.  And the auto-winding mechanism is a real plus.  If, like me, you find yourself the owner of multiple watches in these days of expensive batteries for quartz models, replacing power cells can become a high-priced hassle.  All you have to do is wear this watch and move around normally and it runs without a thought. The only downer for me is that I want to give my other watch models some wrist time too, so then things tend to run down.  But then, just pick it up, set it, strap it on, and off you go.  I have always found it quite accurate enough for my ordinary time-keeping purposes.

One of the classic and attractive feature of diver watches is the rotator elapsed time bezel.  If you like the countdown timer feature on your digital watch, this rotator simply does the same thing in an analog way.  Just turn the 0 indicator to the preset position of the minute or second hand and WATCH (yes, pun intended) how much time goes by.  There is also a a version of this elapsed time ring in red (from 0 to 20 secs.) and blue (from 20 to 60 secs.).  If you want a slightly different dive-watch look, I've found that these replacement rotators are readily available on the net.

The jet-black face makes for a bold, easy-to-see-at-a-glance contrast with the square-cut hour markers and  attention-grabbing hour and minute indicators.  Another plus here is long lasting glow in the dark visibility.  Some other brand's marine model I've got has markers that fade to invisibility after an hour or so in the dark.  You can tell time on this watch all night long and even, I suppose, in murky water.  There's even a luminous dot at 0 secs. on the elapsed time rotator.

The 22 mm. black rubber waterproof strap, held in place by heavy duty, industrial strength spring pins, makes a great looking match with this steel and black watch.  And apparently Seiko diver straps are indestructible.  Other rubber straps seem to be programmed to serve their brief time and then self-destruct.  But even the band I've used on my Seiko 150m for 16 or 17 years shows no sign of cracking or breaking.  After wearing this watch for a while the heavy strap seemed to mold itself to the size and shape of my wrist.  It just sort of makes itself at home on your arm.

The steel case has a great look of solidity and a pleasant heftiness.  It's big (42 mm across) but not geeky big, just the right size and weight to project a certain masculine handsomeness. A nice design touch is the position of the crown at 4:00 instead of the usual 3:00, not only a nice and noticeable difference, but it doesn't cut into the back of your hand in case of hard work or heavy lifting (one of my favorite watches to wear to the gym).  BTW, the crown is only for stetting the time and date, as it's not needed as a winder.

In case you can't tell, I really like this watch.  So much so that I also got the more recent model SKXA35 with the bright yellow dial (See it on Amazon. Really cool too!).

With the quality and durability of this SKX173, you're in for some long-term watch fun and interested comments like. ""Great watch! Where'd you get it?""

"I love this watch. Paired with a Strapcode super oyster II it has a cool retro style that Im just stoked with. I don't know why the SKX173 isn't as popular or well known as the SKX007. The quality of the piece I received is 5-stars. In fact, this is the first of four Seiko divers Ive owned with a chapter ring that is perfectly aligned! If youve done your homework youve likely heard about this quality control issue. One of the features of the SKX173 I was excited about is the pillow effect of the lume on the markers. Its not quite as pronounced as I was expecting from watching video reviews on YouTube, but Ive never seen the watch in person before, so perhaps its something that shows up more on camera for some reason?  Its a nice piece of goods, how can you go wrong at this price? Lastly, I never reviewed the Strapcode super oyster Im using, so let me comment on it. Love it. 5-star quality and worth the price I paid on Amazon. Mine fits the lugs perfectly, and from what Ive read this was not always the case.

Now that that's out of the way...
I have worn a Seiko SKX173 Diver's 200m, everyday....for nearly 18 years.
It just died!
After 18 years of being worn by a studio mechanic/stage technician/kayaking/snorkeling the great lakes/cycling/Motorcyclist/walk-in camping, falling while rollerblading at speed...alot!, ordinary kinda guy with an out of the ordinary though probably boring to most lifestyle.
This watch has been thru thousands of load-ins and dragout. High steel rigging,  wood chopping, set building, days on end on the loading bridge at the Detroit Opera House.
The watch is always on.
18 years of being the most dependable time piece for the money and beyond....with out fail.

I'd say it was monies well spent!!
And if this is your first foray into the world of better watches.....in my humble opinion you just can't go wrong with this legendary time piece.

It's not cost effective to repair mine.
(it has many injury.)

One of those ""for a few dollars more I can just buy a brand new one"" momments.
(hmmmm...the version with the yellow face is sharp).

But I think for most owners this watch would become a family heirloom.
I'd also suggest googling the history and roots of this particular Seiko series of diver's watches.
It's a fascinating read.

Dive watches are inherently tough...this have to be.
The Seiko SKX series is certainly one of the toughist....though for the money I really don't think you can do better.
And ofcourse... No batteries required.

"I went back and forth between the SKX173 and the 007. Purchased the 173 because I liked the dial better (rectangular hour markers) and wanted the 3 year warranty (peace of mind). At first, the watch felt a little smaller than 42mm. But after a little while on the wrist, I realized that because the watch sits a little taller on the wrist (than say a Seiko Monster) and distance between the lugs is shorter, it makes is seem like it's smaller. For me, this older, workhorse Seiko movement has been great. It has been gaining roughly about 7-15 seconds per day, not bad for ISO certified, sub $300 watch. I posted a few pics on my now reduced 6 3/4 wrist. The pics show the watch with a Strapcode Super Jubilee bracelet.",Excellent Everyday Automatic Diver,5.0,B00068TJ76

"Just listen. YouTube YouTube YouTube. YouTube this watch. I wasn't really even in the hardcore market for a watch. But was kinda interested. And I'm by no means a watch expert but WOW how good can a $230 automatic dive watch be? I mean aren't ""good"" watches $500+? $1,000+? I get it. I mean my favorite watch of all time is a Rolex Submariner and that's $8,000 bucks. No I'm not comparing this to a Sub.... but wow. I'll compare this watch to a bull dozer.

Why did I mention YouTube? Because YouTube the SKX173. You'll see all kinds of related videos for this watch and the sister watch, the SKX007. These watches... for the money.... ARE AMAZING. The jewel movement is insane good. I know this is open to debate (what isn't?) but the fact people have a cult-like following on this watch is more than note-worthy. This watch is incredible. Go to YouTube and see what the experts say. You won't be disappointed.

Also NO I didn't get paid to say this AT ALL. I paid for his watch. I'm a regular Joe-blow, I work for the city. This is regular ol' consumer review.

No it doesn't have hacking or manual winding (google what that means), but this 7S23 movement is a tank. I won't make you read more. You CANNOT AT ALL find a better watch for the money. It's a SOLID diver and an amazing automatic for $230 bucks.

I had planned on sending it back and Amazon forwarded the return information.  At that point, the watch appeared to be fine, so I cancelled the return.

"This is a wonderful looking watch for a man. It oozes masculinity, it's good for diving, has strong lume, nice size. But the movement is pure crap! The watch reserve is way under 40 hours plus you have to regulate it to have a decent accuracy. But the power reserve is a deal breaker for me, It stops in less than 10 hours after you take it off your wrist. After all, this is a watch, not a Stainless Steel bracelet!

Other than trying the metal bracelet from Seiko for this watch and having it fall off twice before going back to the rubber bands, it's been flawless. I had it serviced about 2 years ago and still runs great. It's been beat to hell. I ride a motorcycle 12+ hours a day and it's never let me down.

"After months of scouring the internet, I decided my next watch was going to be an automatic diver. Not knowing much about watches, I found that the  popularity, historical performance and price of the Seiko SKX007 was the watch to purchase. Having never worn an automatic watch, I did not have an opinion on specific pros and cons of the watch. My hope that this review may may be helpful.

SKX007 and SKX173: The SKX007 is the International version and the 173 is the Northern American variety. As far as the mechanical movement and size, it is the same. Amazon is selling the 173 at a premium, so that is a bummer. My reason for selecting the 173 over the 007 was the watch face and style of the seconds hand. Take a closer look and you will see what I am writing about. The 173 in my opinion is better for the seconds hand design, especially where the lume is located.

Watch size, shape and weight- This watch feels heavy and durable. While the stainless steel case has brushed sections, the steel portions are shiny overall. I would have preferred that the coined edge of the bezel was matted or brushed instead. The shiny look gives it a cheap feel. The crown has a polished finish with no emblem or signature on it. I do find screwing the crown was a challenge the first couple of times. The threads just did not want to catch. I do love the crown position at the 4 o'clock position. At 43mm, it may be too large for 6-in wrists. Buying a replacement wrist strap my improve the fit. I did not like the feel of the rubber strap, so I ordered a nato strap. Fit was much better- this is all subjective.

SKX173 movement and percision- I agree that mechanical movements have a style and presence that is hard to beat. I kept reading that thr SKX was an entry level watch. There is a reason for this. The movement, while 'robust', is not the most accurate. Due to the quality control standards, these watches could have a wide range in accruacy. My SKX173 was 40 seconds slow a day  from the start. After a few weeks it was approximately 30 seconds slow. I ended up opening the caseback and adjusting the timing myself. While I enjoyed experience,  I am a novice watch tinkerer. I have no idea if the seals are properly seated. My 200m watch may soon be a $240 paperweight. After one nudge with a match stick, my watch is running 7-10 seconds fast a day. I can live with that.

While I didn't think I would care about the winding and hacking option, my experience with my SKX changed my tune. I do prefer the ability to wind and hack a mechanical watch. After adjusting the watch numerous times (when it was running slow), I would have loved to have the second hand start at the 12 o'Clock position. Shaking my watch to wind it gets old and the acted my be misconstrued as something else.

I know I'm missing other thoughts but I'm running short on time. The lume is excellent. It's a small thing, but I really enjoy seeing the color difference in the day (SAT is blue and SUN is red, rest of the days are black). Overall I love the watch. Knowing what I know now, I wouldn't buy it again. Hacking and winding is an important option for me. At this price range, I would recommend an Orient diver with the 200m and hack/wind option. If you are certain a Seiko is for you, save up for a higher tier version ($300-$400 range). I haven't researched enough to know. Thank you for reading.",My first automatic diver review,4.0,B00068TJ76

"...not to slight Casio, it has its place.  However, this watch I've owned for over a year and it looks and feels like a Rolex GMT in heft and quality.  The question is why would anyone want to spend $5k on a Rolex when it costs the manufacturer less than a grand to produce this watch?  Resaleability, you say?  Watches are not investments, they're jewelry or tools (preferably for real men).  As such, they are all poor investments, sans the occasional Patek.  But who has upwards of $20k to spend?  I first boiled and then immediately froze this Seiko in my frezer; you know what?  It still keeps fairly accurate time and never skipped a beat.  Excellent quality for the money.

I've used this watch as my main diving watch for years and it performs better than any other watch I have ever used, super bright markers, very accurate automatic 21 jewel movement, just a great watch.

As for the watch itself, I've only had it for a few hours. Here are my first impressions: It is massive and manly, made of highly polished stainless steel with a dark blue face and a rotating blue and red bezel. A Diver's watch, it is rated for immersion in saltwater to 200 meters. It is automatic and so no battery is needed. The luminous paint used on the hands and hour marks is not tritium but a glow-in-the-dark paint that Seiko claims will glow for 5 to 8 hours after 10 minutes exposure to bright light. This is the only feature that I have a problem with. The price was the lowest I saw on the internet with some venders asking up to seventy five dollars more.

"Not a bad gift for someone that needs to complement a suit. I waited until I had owned it for over a year to give a fair review. My Citizen Eco Drive was destroyed and I didn't have $500+ to replace it for my new job; I needed something inexpensive to complete my business dress. This watch was perfect for that. Still shines like it did when I opened the box. The face has no scratches, even though I tend to smack it against my desk from time to time. The instruction manual is a single page, easy to understand PDF manual on Invicta's website (big plus).

Most people are mystified about how to re-size the band. Nothing is simpler, and it's far cheaper than taking it to a jeweler. I have included a picture of the tool I bought at the same time I bought the watch. I think Amazon sells them for around $5-6.

"Invicta appears to have 2 class action lawsuits pending.  One for misrepresenting their watches as ""diving watches"" and the other for charging for warranty work.  My Invicta 9211 has water inside of it, from poor manufacturing.

Don't spend your money on Invicta watches.  I own two, and won't buy another.  I was told by their repair center that the $28 fee is standard for warranty work.  Ask yourself if you think you should pay to resolve a manufacturer defect.  The answer is ""no"" -- Further, Invicta in their lawsuit defense essentially backpedaled on their own marketing claims of their products.  See for yourself with a simple google search ""Invicta Watch Class Action Lawsuit.""

"I've owned more than 100 watches in the past 30 years, most of which have been dive watches (Seiko, Omega, Rolex, etc)  Needless to say, those watches were between $400-$3,500.  I wasn't expecting a whole lot from this Invicta but I figured, for 50 bucks it was worth a try.

So far it seems to be a decent watch for the price.  The manual is rather ridiculous tho(in my opinion). It presumes that you have no clue what a wristwatch does.  I had to laugh when it said: ""the battery will have to replaced eventually"".  Every watch I have owned that was battery operated at least mentioned the lifetime of the battery... 1 year, 3 years, 10 years. I also think the manual could have been more specific as to the model I bought.  It is a generic manual which talks about all the types of watches and what the hands are for (chronographs, etc). It assumes the consumer is an idiot as far as wristwatches go. Other than these minor observations I'd say that if you want a nice looking watch that seems fairly well made and is accurate, and you want it to be under $100.... this Invicta isn't bad at all.",Not a bad watch for 50 bucks,4.0,B0006AAS7E
"I had always wanted a Rolex diver's watch but at $4,000 to $5,000 it would be hopelessly out of my price range. The Invicta looks ""close enough"" although not as beefy as the Rolex. I'm amazed at it's accuracy for such an inexpensive watch. It feels great and looks great. I only wished they used Tritium or something similar on the hands and face so it would glow longer. It's always a plus when you can see the time in the dark. I don't intend to scuba dive with it but I'm not worried if I take it snorkeling.

"(EDIT: Amazon now has the specs correctly listed at 37mm diameter.)

Amazon's description is wrong on the case diameter.  I bought this watch and the 8926 automatic thinking they were the same size (43mm with crown).  Not so, this watch is quite a bit smaller on the wrist, not as heavy(no automatic movement), and the unidirectional bezel is much more loose and cheap feeling.

The model # on the back of this watch is 8932A

The 8926 is a MUCH nicer watch and has been on sale for 70 at various times.","Case diameter is 39mm, not 43mm like the 8926",3.0,B0006AAS7E
"The watch is the same design as the popular automatic version, but I've found that watches that depend upon movement for power are notoriously unreliable.  Thus, I opted for the quartz powered one.  The watch design is bold and striking, with classic styling, and a face size that is just right.  The box it comes in is deceptively bulky and unwieldy, but the watch itself is a gem.  A great gift for any man.",Beautiful and striking men's watch,5.0,B0006AAS7E
"Purchasing the #8932 Invicta dive watch for a family member Christmas present - I've come away very much impressed. The 8932 apparently shares the case, crystal mineral glass watchface, screwdown crown and elegent lightweight stainless steel bracelet with it's more expensive automatic movement 8926 sibling. Matter of factly - it is hard to tell the difference between this watch and Invicta's $300+ 9937 Swiss ETA powered automatic diver without close inspection.

It is my humble opinion that Invicta is the leader of the affordable price dive watch market - including such giants as Seiko and Citizen - OK maybe even Casio. Invicta does not have the brand name awareness of the public and large commercial outlets to display their wonderful dive watches. Once you've purchased an Invicta Pro-Diver series watch - you will be a fan. The fit, finish, overall quality and design make this watch a model you should consider as a price range leader.

Case: The 316L brushed stainless steel case at 40mm (43mm with crown) once considered a large watch - is now an ""average"" size for dive watches. The stainless steel watchback might be annoying for those with nickel metal skin allergies - the mineral glass display or ""exhibition"" watch backs of the 8926 and 9937 being preferred by many divers. Mineral glass is not as scratch resistant as sapphire crystal as found in the 9937 - which can only be imprinted by diamond - but is ""good enough"" for average wear and certainly keeps the watch very affordable. A date ""cyclops"" or window is found at the 3 o'clock position. The watch is rated and tested to 200m (660 ft) - that which qualifies it as a ""Professional Diver"".

Bezel: The black bezel is a very scratch resistant, uni-directional (120 clicks to the hour) scalloped edge (like the Omega Seamaster) diving tool. A ""coin edge"" (like the Rolex Submariner) bezel is preferred by many divers - being less slippery to manipulate when wet.

Bracelet: Invicta's ss bracelet - with polished center links - is an industry standard - best compared to a Rolex Oyster bracelet for the Submariner series. It utilizes a foldover deployment clasp without a wetsuit deployment clasp as found on more expensive dive watch bracelets. Held together by pins - it is important to throughly rinse the bracelet after immersion in salt water.

Movement: The 8932 uses a quartz ""asian"" sourced movement. These will normally keep time +/- 15 second per week and are actually much more accurate than the more expensive Invicta 8926 Citizen/Miyota 8215 - 21 jewel automatic movements that can be a minute or more off each week. The 9937 uses a Swiss ETA 2824-2 25 jewel automatic movement reflected in it's $300+ price tag...Watch battery life varies as per movement source and battery quality. Most batteries should last 3-5 years according to Invicta users I know.

Conclusion: I am a big fan of Invicta dive watches. For the money, Invicta Pro-Diver series watches are an industry leader. Sourced among many different asian assemblers - the fit, finish and quality may vary somewhat from batch to batch - but the overall reputation among watch collectors of the Invicta Pro-Diver series is very high!

Why not 5 stars? My personal preferences are automatic movement watches - not quartz. The stainless steel back can irritate the skin of allergic individuals. Mineral glass crystal - used to hold the price - is prone to scuffing and minor scratching. Sapphire is too expensive for this category of watch. As a diver - I prefer a ""sawtooth"" or ""coin"" edged bezel to the scalloped bezel currently offered by Invicta. The bracelet offers no wetsuit deployment clasp - a feature absent in all Invicta divers thru the 9937 series. Some or none of these should prevent you from considering this watch or it's 8926 fraternal twin as your next dive watch.

Amazon and it's sellers do a good job to deliver the Invicta goods. All models come with a one year warranty - Invicta offering a 5 year warranty extension for a modest fee.

"Overall, I like it. First, it's not a serious diver's watch. It's just called that as a model style. It's looks similar to a well known luxury watch brand and that was the reason I bought it. It's for casual or dress wear but I wouldn't expect it to stand up to  hard everyday use like my Timex. It looks good, the watch hands are easy to read  even without glasses(for me anyway - although the date is a little hard to see). There are glow in the dark markers for the hands and the hour markers and the top of the rotating bezel which does work if you want to use it. The band locks down and has enough adjustment at the latch for bigger wrists. The only negative part is I thought the watch face would be bigger.","It's a dress watch, not a scuba watch.",4.0,B0006AAS7E

I was so excited to receive it in the mail, but when I tried to adjust the time with the dial, it turns out it was stuck.

If the alarm works I can not hear it, and it apparently must be reset every 12 hours so is worthless for my use.  A friend got a watch with a great alarm system at Radio Shack for under $30. Also I believe the amount charged was too much.  I am NOT HAPPY!",disappointment,2.0,B00070OWVQ
"Bought this watch at retail and paid $ 350.  Should have come to Amazon first and saved $100.

Watch keeps time, never needs a battery change, is easy to read, has a calendar, an alarm, and looks cool...what more could one want?

This watch also has a ""perpetual"" calendar that is preset at the factory.  Watch knows month length and leap year so you won't have to reset date for short months.  It is a little complicated to set the date -- so it is a good thing it is preset at the factory.  Best thing:  I will never have to reset the date until February 28 2100 when there is no leap year!  I should live so long!

The Amazon description fails to mention that this watch also has two time zones.  ""Time"" and ""Local Time"".  Unfortunately, you can only display one time-zone at a time.  To switch time zones, you need to pull the crown out, turn it slightly...and then wait.  The hands will spin around to the new time, the day hand will spin around to the new day, and then the calendar will flip.  This is really cool to look at and handy when you are flying from one time-zone to another.  To go 15 hours from PDT to China time This whole process takes more than a minute.  So it is not useful for quick lookups.  This is perhaps the watch's greatest drawback.  If you need a watch to simultaneously display multiple time zones, Seiko alarm chronographs or else the Bulova Millenia with 4 time zones are good alternatives.

The alarm is easy to set and works for local time as well.  If you set it for 7am while in the main time zone and then switch to Local time, the alarm rings at 7am in the local time.

Citizen's ""Eco-Drive"" solar powered system is pre-charged at the factory.  Power reserve is 180 days!!!  It only takes about a Norwegian summer day of sunlight to bring the watch from empty to fully charged.  The watch will also charge from normal indoor light.  Citizen ships the watches fully charged from their factory.  If the watch is on display at your local jeweler, it should be fully charged when you buy it.  I guess that full charge is what I paid $ 100 extra for by buing at retail.

-----

Update after about one-year of ownership:

There are a few things that bug me a little about this watch.

1)  The knob does not lock in place and can pop out easily.  This happens to me about once a month.  Usually, I discover it when I look at my watch and discover the hands spinning around wildy resetting the time.

One time the calendar got set.  Resetting the perpetual calendar is really complicated.  Fortunately, Citizen has a fantastic on-line audio-video tutorial that walks you through the process.  Takes about 20 minutes to reset.

2)  The clasp on the band can pop open.  This usually happens when my hands are full of hot coffee cups.

3)  The watch is pretty heavy.

I think I would rate this watch 4 stars after one year.  But Amazon doesn't let you change the stars when you edit.",Doh!  Should have come to Amazon 1st -- would've saved $ 100,5.0,B00074HDAO
"This review can't be completely comprehensive since I've only had this watch for two weeks now, but it sure is attractive, comfortable and easy to use.

I typically shy away from quartz watches except as cheap work knock-abouts. My best watches are all automatics. I have several Omegas, 3 Rolex's, and 2 TAG's and a Breitling. All Automatics. I also have a Luminox as my ""cheap"" quartz knock-about. I feel that it is silly to have an expensive watch and it be reliant on using a battery. A good watch should be self-sufficient.

Citizen has performed an amazing technological breakthrough with the Eco-Drive movement. It is powered by light through a solar cell underneath the face. The cells are so efficient that they are invisible and it is impossible to tell it is there. They seem to have overcome any limitations of face design, and they now come in a multitude of colors and configurations.

The watches are claimed to never need a battery. The solar cell keeps a capacitor charged and the watch needs amazingly little light exposure. A few minutes a day is all that is needed. Not only that but the power reserve on some Citizen models is meaured in years. I'm not sure about this one but I think it is at least 6 months. AND, the watch can go into a power save mode where the movement is disabled and still keep time. Take the watch into the light for a minute or so and the movement resets and you're back in business.

This watch has a perpetual calendar that knows the month, date and leap year status so the date calendar is always right. This is a terrific touch. There is a little dial that tells you the day of the week, as well as 24 hour dial. Mine the two tone model, gold on a black face and looks terrific.

It has an alarm that while low in db is at a frequency that seems to be able to wake anyone from a deep sleep.

Did I mention that this watch is classically beautiful and can hold it's own quality-wise with any of the high dollar competition from Switzerland. Most people when they see it think it's a Breitling.

The bracelet is heavy and is in my opinion superior the the Rolex Submariner bracelet in terms of feel, comfort and heft. Plus, the clasp has these two little tabs on either side for a nice positive lock similar to the Omegas. Both watches make the normal Rolex Sub bracelet and clasp look cheap, flimsy and unworthy of the price.

I find almost nothing to fault about this watch, but I would have liked to have luminous markers, but the hands glow well and last all night. This watch gives up nothing to a $2000 Breitling.

I am not a watch chauvenist by any means, but I have always like the autos better knowing I am not reliant on an outside thing such as a battery without which my expensive watch is nothing better than a fancy paperweight. I am satisfied with the Eco-Drive concept.

Like most watch guys I value accuracy and this watch has it. I have all my autos tuned to be within a few seconds a month when worn. Wearing an automatic watch in the different arm positions throughout the day averages out the mechanical factors that lead to inaccuracies. In reality and normal use even the best quartz watches generally cannot keep time like a well-tuned automatic.

If a quartz movement is +3 seconds it will always gain no matter if worn or in the box so the time drifts. With an automatic, it may be +3 sec up, but -2 down and +1 sideways etc. When worn a lot the averages stay at near zero variation.

Maybe I got lucky with this one, but I set it to my atomic clock 2 weeks ago. As of this writing it is to the second with the atomic. Your results may vary but I suspect that Citizen has done their homework in the QC department.

This watch is inexpensive yet looks very expensive. The quality of the watch is what I have come to expect from a watch in the $1,000 - $2,500 range. Fool your friends. This watch is a bargain at $475. At the Amazon price of $235 it a steal. I may buy another of a different color. Yes folks this is that good.

"Great looking watch with lots of features, include day, date, month and two time zones. The perpetual calendar feature of this watch appealed to me the most, but when it really counted, it totally failed me. This year, 2017, is a Leap Year +1. I set the watch according to instructions to have it recognize the year as a Leap +1, set for February and the appropriate day. On the flip over to March 1, this watch failed to update either the month or the date to March 1. It remained locked in February on the 29th. I don't know why it failed to acknowledge the correct year to advance the month and date from February to March and 28 to 1. When I manually set it to the correct date, the watch still remembered that it was a Leap +1. This is my first month of ownership, so I haven't tested it on normal 30 day months to see if it flips. Regardless, I'm disappointed in the date mechanics not obeying the settings to change properly. I was hoping to never have to set the day, date and month on this watch again?
UPDATE - August 2017 - The perpetual calendar failure was due to the date not aligning to the ""zero position"". Citizen watches can support an ""all reset"" and a ""zero position"" alignment. I had done the all reset procedure and the dates still didn't change properly in short months, and the month didn't update until the second day of the new month. Once I realized there was another process called ""zero positon alignment"", I found the date to be ahead one day. I reset the date to the correct value of ""1"" for the zero position (some Citizens use ""31"" in the halfway position between 31 and 1, so read your manual carefully). Wala, the watch now changes months and dates properly. I was ready to give up on this fine watch, but just needed to dig deeper to find out how to correct it.","Great looking watch, but perpetual calendar failed to update",4.0,B00074HDAO

I have only had the watch for a short time but it meets all my expectations for a quality watch.

"Absolute crap. I bought a citizen eco-drive years ago, and it has been great. I bought one of these for my son's graduation and it is a terrible piece of junk - I would assume it is a cheap Chinese counterfeit if I didn't get it straight from Amazon. First time he wore it, the band got all scratched at the dinner table, because it was made from cheap metal. The pins all fell out of the band. It's complete crap, and because I gave it to him on a trip, I missed the 30 day return window. Complete crap - so think twice about buying this or ANY citizen watch, and for that matter, any big ticket purchase from Amazon. Very unhappy with the whole situation and now I have no recourse.",NOT a citizen.,1.0,B00074HDAO
"This is an excellent watch. I have owned mine for 2 months now, and wear it daily. It is my second Citizen watch (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Citizen-Men-s-BM6560-54H-Eco-Drive-Titanium-Watch/dp/B0012IVVDO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Citizen Men's BM6560-54H Eco-Drive Titanium Watch</a>), and I was a little uncertain about the weight difference between a titanium watch and stainless steel. First time wearing the new one I knew it wouldn't be a problem at all. Very comfortable and actually prefer it to my previous Citizen watch. Also, it is easier than I expected to set all the fancy features but I did not have to do much, since mine came with calendar, day, and time all near-correct already.

Size - Perfect size for me. I have small wrists and I bought my first Citizen watch because they seem to be the only quality brand that does not exclusively sell wall-clock size watches. I prefer not to look like Flava-Flav.  The case thickness is also not an issue when wearing long-sleeve dress shirts like I do daily.

Weight - As I said above, this was originally a worry for me since I was changing from titanium to stainless steel. While it is noticeable heavier of course, it does not feel annoying or like a brick is hanging from my wrist,

Features - All the fancy features are neat and fun to play with, but was not a specific determining factor for me. All work flawlessly, though can be time consuming to remove the watch to switch it to another mode (for viewing calendar, alarm, or local time).",Excellent watch and great size for smaller wrist,5.0,B00074HDAO
I love these Eco-Drive watches! you never have to worry about changing a dead battery. They keep accurate time and not to menttion they look great.

"This is an excellent watch and a personal favorite.  I'd probably buy it again if I lost it.

-I am not a fan of the big watch fad.  This watch fits in that sweet spot at 39mm, not too big, not too small.  It's difficult to find a quality watch this size with all these features.

-The perpetual calendar is great.  I set the date once when I first bought it 3 years ago and that's it.

-It keeps perfect time.  I only adjust the time for daylight savings time twice a year.

- Easy to adjust.  Fairly intuitive controls.

- I have never had a problem with the battery.  The eco drive works well.  Even if not worn for a while, it starts right back up after seeing light.

- the alarm is easy enough to set.  It's not very loud but many watches don't even have an alarm.

- The Calendar mode is okay.  The second hand points to the month and the small hand that normally identifies the day of the week points to the leap year.

- It also has a local time mode.

- Everything on the dial is easy to read.

****The mineral crystal scratches easily.  I contacted Citizen about this.  They can put in a sapphire crystal for ~$130 ($40 for the parts, $80 for labor and water pressure testing, +shipping).  In my mind, sapphire crystal should come standard with this watch.  The crystal has scratches on the face and chips around the perimeter.

If you are looking for a watch that feels high quality,  then you're looking at the right brand.

This style of watch (33-37/38mm, yellow gold,  white dial, Roman numerals and 4-6mm thickness, with black or burgundy crocodile band) is what politicians, bankers, ivy-leaguers, presidents, judges, and other elite, wear.

"I usually purchase Seiko watches which keep great time, look good and are very reliable.  I could not find a round men's dress Seiko watch that was of a moderate size.  This Longines watch was a perfect find.  It's moderate in size, I measure the case diameter (without the crown) at 33 mm. The watch is thin at 6 mm.  For wrist sizing information the total length of the watch and band is 23 cm. The gold plate is very high quality and I would describe it as a mid-gold tone in colour.  The gold coloured second hand is a nice design touch.  The band is high quality but lighter in weight, which is nice since the watch is also light in weight.  Since this is a high quality quartz watch, it keeps perfect time.  If one is looking for a similar watch with a stainless steel case and white face, have a look at the Longines L47094112.

"This watch has become a classic amongst those wanting a high quality mechanical dive style watch for a very reasonable cost. Invicta automatics use a Citizen/Miyota movement which is very reliable and accurate. Overall, the watch compares favorably with the well regarded Seiko automatic divers. The bracelet quality is worth the price alone. I've had mine for several years and it has been problem free and runs accurately to within a few seconds per day. Upon close inspection, it is not as refined as the Swiss divers which are several price classes above the Invicta, but this remains a handsome and durable watch.

I thought all Invictas came with the really, really nice case (like mine did from JC Penny).  But, his came in a decent cardboard box.  The case would be my only complaint about it.  Still it is a good price for an Invicta.",Good looking watch,4.0,B0006AAS4M
"I don't know what all the controversy and debate is about these watches. Certainly Invicta has made some goofy looking watches in recent years, and yes, it is possible to buy an Invicta watch that has poor fit or finish, or an automatic movement that needs to be adjusted in order to keep good time. But for the amount of money that I paid for this watch, I am compelled to say that it has been an OUTSTANDING value. While I have not worn this watch diving (I do not dive), I have submerged the watch in water while working, without any leakage. I have done very physical activity while wearing the watch, and subjected it to vibration and shocks (while building fences and compacting gravel for instance), and it has continued to keep excellent time. It gains about 6-7 seconds per day, so every Monday since I purchased the watch, I have checked it against the US Naval Observatory's atomic clock, and find that every seven days, for over two months it has gained less than a minute. Which is excellent for ANY automatic movement.
The watch that I purchased does exactly what it advertised doing, and for a VERY reasonable price. I personally think that anyone with complaints about this particular Invicta model has unreasonable expectations about what they should get for under $100 US dollars. I have not had any trouble setting the time or date (as some other buyers have said that they have had), and the hack function (stopping the second hand in order to accurately set the time) works perfectly. The crown screws down smoothly and easily. As you can see from the attached photo, the bezel on the watch that I purchased aligns very well, and while somewhat stiff, works very well. The bracelet is as well made as anyone could reasonably expect for a watch with an MSRP of about $300, and that can be purchased online for less than $100.
Overall, this watch has already exceeded my expectations, and I fully expect that it will be an excellent ""everyday"" watch that I can confidently wear in all conditions, and can count on to keep accurate time within an acceptable margin of error for an automatic movement.

Now Invicta has upgraded the movement to Seiko NH35A, which is actually the Seiko 4R36. This is the reason why I buy the Invicta 8926 OB again, because I prefer this movement than the old one. Hacking is very important to me.

There is a lot of debates on Invicta watches. I think it really depends on what angle you are looking at. This watch is not for your social status, a Rolex might serve it much more better. However, if you just want to enjoy a little bit fun of mechanical watchmaking without spending a fortune, and doesn't care how other thinks about this watch..

"I wrote a review back in 2009 for a watch that was similar to this one, so I will just go ahead and post what I had written 6 years ago:
------------------
2009:

I've recently purchased my new Casio remote control watch from Amazon for a great price and an amazing deal, considering that this type of watch goes for $50+ at my local Walmart. My only gripe with this product is that, after about 2 years or so, the battery completely dies out. I've tried to replace the battery in the back of the watch twice, only to discover that, after putting everything back together again, the new battery does not work, even though it's the same exact brand and make of the battery that's included with the watch, even positioning the battery the correct way.

It's a great item to have if you like pulling pranks on your friends or changing the channel at your local restaurant, but be prepared to have to fully replace the watch every 2 years or so. I'm already on my third Casio remote watch within the past 5 years, but I absolutely love them. I would never consider getting another standard watch, even without the remote functions, as these watches are very durable and reliable during the 2 years of use I get out of them.
------------------
2015:

Seeing as how it's currently the year 2015, I do not believe the T.V. functions are incredibly useful anymore.  Obviously the VCR functions cannot do anything unless you happen to stumble across somebody who still lives in the '90s.  It was great to play pranks on friends and people in bars/restaurants, but, I cannot get it to work most of the time.  It is, however, still good for the date and time.

This watch fits my needs perfectly, the time display is large enough to easily read, and the crystal is flat.

"I'm a runner/triathlete and I've used an Ironman Datalink watch before with good results. I wanted more memories and the Flix system, a cute gimmick. Watch works, but after using for a while, I have some issues, mainly with the Flix system. Here are my complaints:

1) Top display is too small in chrono mode. This is where your current split is displayed. Center display showing total time is fine, but top is not easily readable while running. Makes reading it a chore. Many other icons too small to read easily, like ""chrono running"" and ""chrono stopped"".
2) I'm not a fan of having the chrono STOP button right beside the start/split button on the face of the watch. In a race, it's too easy to hit the stop button and mess up everything. Keep the stop button far away on the side, like the original Datalink watch.
3) Date format in time mode is 'YY. MM-DD in that tiny top display. Who needs to see the year at all, much less first? Confusing. Is it August, or '08?
4) There's no ""Night Mode"" or Flix icon on the watch. My old Datalink had one! How do I know if Flix mode is on?
5) The Indiglo night light is fairly dim.
6) BIG ONE: The Flix mode self-cancels after a few hours, for mysterious reasons not explained in those microscopic superfolded instructions. I tried two different watches, same result. Maddening. Now I have to use my hand to turn on hands-free Flix mode. Not smart.
6) The Flix mode must triggered by a fairly violent punching maneuver, a strong SNAP perpendicular to the watch face. It takes a fair amount of effort, and you might hit yourself or someone next to you. You'd certainly wake up someone sleeping beside you. Eventually, you might throw out your elbow accelerating your entire wrist and forearm. Wouldn't a nice snappy wrist twist be more user friendly and less injurious?

The watch looks good, fits well, holds a lot of timing splits, and performs its timing functions properly. But in terms of ergonomics and user friendliness, Timex could have made better use of this watch's features. I give it a B-.",Useful but Flawed,3.0,B00006I5YG

The watch itself works fine and chimes out the intervals exactly as programmed but I found the instructions to be printed in type that so small that they were hard to read.

"I purchased this item to use on my swimming practice...

I have been doing some pace training and I need the countdown function and the Chrono as well...

And it works perfect... Althouhgh many might mention that just about every clock has this kind of functions nowadays... BUT...

..What I like about this watch is the memory on it :-)

It will store my practice time with the Average Time, Best Time and all Laps and Splits on it, and it stores by Day (year/month/day)!!

And with a 100 Memory for it.. I have plenty to keep up with..

The feel of the buttons is something that helps a lot when you have to do it yourself (press the buttoms and swim at the same time)...

A Countdown Timer that starts the Chrono right after it ends is perfect for some quick time tracking as well...

The ability to set the amount of Reps at the countdown and with different intervals is also a a great ""trainer""....

The Watch has also a MEMO Function which I do not think I shall be using, but for some it might be quite handy, the memo with the multi function alarm.

It fits well and the Flix Technology (I really like that) works Great, with just the right movement the Indigo light comes on...

Really Cool...

"I am a professional pianist, and I have very slender wrists, so when I was shopping for a new watch I wanted to find the thinnest and lightest watch possible for a reasonable price, so that I can wear it while playing without it being a distraction.  (Often in the past I would take off my watch at the piano while playing, and occasionally leave it behind.)

This Skagen fits those requirements.  The metal band has such a fine mesh that it feels surprisingly soft and comfortable, and it doesn't lead to as much sweat underneath the watch as a leather or plastic band.  This model has a fairly small dial and is extremely thin.  (Skagen does offer some models that are even slightly thinner, but lack the date and second hand.  I could live without the date, but lacking a second hand would drive me nuts, I think I would be constantly checking to see if it is running.)  The double clasp is fairly easy to use and very secure.

In the past I have preferred my watches to have digital/analog dual display, so as to have the overall appearance of a traditional watch but also having features such as stopwatch and alarm.  This time I decided to give those extra features up for a super-slim watch as previously mentioned.  These days, most of us have those features available on a laptop, PDA or cell phone anyway if really needed in a pinch.

The appearance is very minimal, understated, and elegant:  Slender silver hands and small silver indicator dots on a very-slightly-shiny textured black face.  In some light, such as on stage with very bright overhead lighting, it can be hard to pick out the hands from the glare of the light, but this is not a common or serious concern.  Also, as mentioned by others, the number in the date display is microscopically small.  (Anyone looking at the watch who wasn't close enough to be wearing it might think the number dial was a decorative marker like the Movado dot, rather than a functional number.  Overall, this is not the kind of watch you glance at briefly from arm's length to immediately get a positive reading.  It's comfortable enough to wear and forget, and if you need to know the time, or especially the date, you have to really LOOK at it.)  I should also add that the elegant black and silver appearance nicely complements my typical concert attire, i.e. either all black or black tuxedo.

I have owned this watch for two months now and have had no serious problems, and it keeps reasonably accurate time.  Some minor things:  When the watch is new out of the box, all of the clasps and fittings are VERY tight.  This is a good thing, probably, but it also means that it is quite hard to get the clasp to snap closed, for one, and it is nearly impossible to open the clutch to adjust the band without bending the pin where the clasp hooks on.  I DID, in fact, bend the pin myself, but not enough to cause serious damage or prevent the clasp from working.  Once the clasp has been broken in a bit, it snaps closed more easily.

Another thing I noticed is that someone, most likely the assembly technician at the factory, partly stripped out the Phillips head of one of the set screws that hold the band onto the watch body.  A minor point, but it is a minor detraction from an otherwise perfectly engineered product, and makes one wonder whether it would cause problems for the jeweler in the event of the band needing replacement.

Overall I am extremely pleased with the watch so far.  Obviously if you are a big guy with thick wrists who likes a hefty watch, this would not be the one for you, but if you like a small, light, thin, dressy watch, this is one to consider.","Elegant, thin and comfortable",4.0,B0000C9ZCQ

"I have three Skagen watches. I really liked the way the first one looked so I got another one for casual use.

One of them is the blue version of this, 355LSSN. They are beautiful. I would never buy a Skagen watch again, however. Here are the issues I have with them:

Most importantly, everything about this watch is proprietary. Changing batteries is a pain as you can't find them locally and it costs $14.95 and they do not seem to last long. Bands are proprietary as well and is $34.95 (The watch is $58.20 as of now!!!) Also you better keep your sales receipt even though they have lifetime warranty (so who cares when you bought it??)

As for their customer service, it is terrible. I sent in my replacement band and battery with payment for two watches in July and they cashed the check and didn't receive anything until January.  I called them and they promised to send a free battery as an apology, but when I received the items finally in March, no battery was included (let alone a free one). I gave up.

Other issues:

a) Wire mesh bands: The clasp is not always tight and over time will slide and get a little loose. Also the titanium mesh is made of tiny small circles of metal interlocked and if one of them gets open (say you hit something), it starts unraveling slowly but surely.

b) Leather band: The one I have fell apart so quickly it is surprising. It also started smelling bad due to sweat (I do not sweat that much and I owned other watches with leather bands). This seems to be a very bad quality.

c) Water - my watch started fogging after 2 years of light usage.

I will NOT buy another Skagen watch. Their customer service and business practices are shady. They are great watches when they work.

"Like a pretty prominent percentage of people here, Skagen's great & elegant looks plus affordability was what attracted me, and despite being the low-income-earning-grad-student:) next door, I ended up gifting my nearest family members (4 of them), a Skagen each!!
The watches did arrive on time, and looked pretty sweet-n-spiffy in their nice boxes. Except this one, which looked kind of dusty and old. Anyhow, I am not a finicky person, and so that was hardly a big deal, but after my father had worn it for like a mere 3-4 times, he realized the watch wasn't working!! It was dead as a Dodo!!
Now, he's very careful and cautious in dealing with such delicate stuff, so I am 101% sure that it wasn't that the watch hit anything (or vice versa) or that it came in contact with water or something...
I hope it's just the battery, and not something drastic that's occured to it. Plus I hope the other watches work fine... so that I can write positive reviews about them, sometime! :)

In fact, this is my second watch as I had the 1st one stolen. Cleaning the glass surface though is not always easy! You might need a special cloth to get rid of even the tiny water drops.

Skagen watches are top notch accessories. Stylish and utilitarian at the same time. This particular watch is an outstanding watch to add to any collection. Its easily adjustable metallic band is great for those who hate watches clunking around on their wrist. The thinness of the watch face is outstanding for use while wearing long-sleeved shirts. The simple elegance of the design is terrific. This is a great product.,Thin & Light,5.0,B0000C9ZCR
"I bought this watch and while I love how slim it is I have found two problems.

1. The face is difficult to see in certain light conditions and has no glow for nighttime.

2. The crystal is exposed on the face of the watch and as I have just experienced, it is easy to chip, scratch, or crack.  Replacement from Skagen costs almost $35 and two weeks turnaround and most watch repair stores were quoting a $40-50 repair cost.","Looks nice, but flawed",3.0,B0000C9ZCR
"Hi,

I really like this Skagen watch and I have been watching for price drop. It was priced at 95$ and Amazon dropped it to 72$ just couple of weeks back and I just grabbed this good deal.

The wrist band could be easily altered to fit your wrist, the blue dial stands out amazingly with the silver wrist band, Very light weight.

Only issue I have is the metal mesh sometimes catches your wrist hair on your hand :) but maybe if you keep wearing it for few days it should be fine ...

I really like this watch and it's worth the price.

I was directed to the Skagen Service and Repair department in Reno, NV.  I placed my order ($30+) and never heard back from them.  After countless telephone calls, I finally received a generic letter stating that the band was out of stock and might have to wait 90 days for its replacement. I was reluctant, but had no other choice to report them to the BBB.  Within 3 days my replacement band was received!

"Skagen make excellent watches. Primarily they feature incredibly thin watch faces and slick mesh bands. They also produce a wide variety of designs, but I think this is one of their best. The hour marks are reduced to silver rivets on the frame of the watch face. Additionally, the face is divided into quarters that lighten and darken with every orientation. This creates a subtly sophisticated but practical watch face.

The watches aren't perfect though. Their movement is rather loud so that I can hear every second tick several feet away on my bedstand at night. Also the mesh band deforms slightly with constant use, but I've been wearing this watch nearly daily for three years through work, hiking, yardwok, etc. Any Skagen in the Titanium line makes a good purchase.",Great Everyday Watch,4.0,B0000C9ZDM

"This is a very neat dress watch. I recommend it, despite the comments below. It is a bit smaller than I expected, but was very good value. I may look for something a bit chunkier for sporty outings. The hands and date are easy to read despite the plain dial. The quartering on the dial looks good. I managed to adjust the timne and date without reading the instructions

Difficulties? I struggled to adjust the strap - you need a screwdriver and a good grasp of engineering and the manual is not much use. I initially got the clasp on backwards and also had a lot of difficulty closing the clips. Then when I had the strap the right length I found it quite hard to do the bracelet up. If you buy this (and I hope you will) do practice over a table  and do not have the strap very tight - it won't do up like that.",looks great,4.0,B0000C9ZDM

"I bought a Titanium Skagen a few years ago. I've sent it back several times - once for moisture in the case and once it quit running and a new battery wouldn't solve the problem. It was repaired both times in short order for only a postage charge. I bought this 430LSX on impulse at a national discount/overstock brick and mortar store. I like the thinness and simplicity of the Skagen design. Two comments about this site and the one of the reviews. The instructions book (as minimal as it is) says if the watch does not say water resistant then it is not. Amazon claims that this is good to 99 feet. The brochure says: NON WATER-RESISTANT - No marking on watch; WATER RESISTANT 3-5 ATM - Can withstand splashes of water while washing hands or in the rain; WATER RESISTANT 10 ATM - Suitable for swimming and snorkeling, but should not be used for diving. My Titanium 105LTXN plainly says on the back: WATER RESISTANT 100FT. Secondly, to the reviewer that said the watch was too big: The bands are adjustable. You can take links out on either side of the clap to shorten them by a bunch. On the inside of the band you will see small arrows. That tells you which way to push on the extremely tiny ""cotter pins"" on the edge of the band that hold the links together. A diaper pin with the plastic protective head (very sturdy steel) or the smallest of those small screwdriver kits will push them out. It may take A LOT more force than you would think. They go back in from the side they came out, not the side you pushed on. I've sized two Skagens and a Seiko. They are all a little different but same principle.

"I have two very good watches (Swiss Army and Tissot), but was just browsing in a Target store and really couldn't resist this little watch.  I think this is a great value for a casual watch.  Same thing could be said for many other Timex and Casio watches I'm sure, but this one stole my attention.

First thing, it looks great, very simple and clear face, it is light beige (not white).  Actually, it looks a lot better in person than what you see in this photo here.

Has a nice leather & polypropylene strap, all leather on the inner side by the way, it is remarkably comfortable and very light.  (If you like heavy and bulky watches then this might not be your kind of watch.)  Water resistant down to 50m, quick-date feature, and last but not least, it has the Timex trademark indiglo night-light.

The only minor drawbacks I could find in this watch are: 1) It doesn't have a mineral or sapphire crystal (but hey it's a $25 watch! you won't get those crystals anywhere near this price range anyway); and 2) The tic tac sound is louder than I would have liked.  But those aren't real issues at this price.  If you want tougher crystals, very quiet mechanics, or features like a perpetual calendar or chrono and whatnot etc., you simply have to pay a lot more.

What this unassuming great looking casual Timex watch offers is just good value.",Very good value,4.0,B0000TIIS2
"This watch is a real deal.  It is rugged and dependable, waterproof, and very comfortable.  It's very lightweight and is noiseless, so you don't have to worry about a jingle alerting whatever quarry you're hunting.  The watch is attached to the band via an elastic shock-strap that prevents sudden impacts from ripping it off the band.  All in all, a very effective design.  <br />
<br />
The ""quick date"" function assumes there are 31 days in every month, so after the shorter months you need to adjust forward a day or two for it to be correct.  This is no big deal, and is common to most analog watches with this feature.<br />
<br />
My personal experiences with this watch have taken it hunting in all corners of the backwoods of Kentucky, as well as backpacking through the smokies and the titons.  It has proven to be extraordinarily tough.  I had had problems with other watches with the watch coming separated from the band after a tug or strong bump (such as taking off a rucksack and having it's strap catch on the watch bezel), but the elastic loaded shock attachment on this Timex seems to have eliminated those problems.  <br />
<br />
The only down side to this watch that I have found is that the bright-white watch face is quite noticeable at a distance in the woods.  So if you plan to take this watch hunting then make sure it's under a sleeve cuff or it could quite easily give you away.  Otherwise the white face contributes to readability, even for those whose eyesight isn't quite what it used to be.<br />

If you're looking for an analog, easy to read watch that is tough enough to match your lifestyle, then this just might be the pick.<br />

I've swam in it a couple times, done dishes, showered, etc.  When I stripped paint it was protected by gloves.  There has been nothing extraordinary enough to warrant a malfunction.

The glass has remained relatively scratch free, and this is not due to any extra care on my part.  The metal has a few scratches but nothing to diminish the overall attractiveness.

"Kenneth Cole Reaction - Digital Watch A126-03-RK5034 Battery is CR2016

This is a customer written manual / tutorial.
This tutorial may be similar to other Reaction Digital watches with 4 buttons.

GENERAL DATA:

The RK5034 is a unique split face digital watch in a heavy metal enclosure.

The Case is 42mm in width, 50cm in length top to bottom, and 15cm in height.

The case is reported to be brass plated with a brushed nickel type of matte, non-gloss surface.

Therefore the main case itself may or may not be solid stainless steel. (it looks like brushed stainless)

The back plate is definitely stainless steel and is removable via 4 screws.

The four buttons, two per side are oval in shape and are shiny chromed metal.

Overall, the watch has a very solid weight and feel and feels good on the wrist.

FEATURES:

It has Time (hours-minutes-seconds), Date (month-day), Stop Watch, and Alarm features.

It has four buttons, 2 on the left, two on the right.

Setting features will likely be very similar to other similar styled digital watches.

The TOP LEFT button is the illumination features which highlights all alpha-numeric figures in blue.

To my knowledge the top left button has no other feature aside from illuminating the LCD display.

The BOTTOM LEFT button is the primary MODE button for viewing and setting all functions.

The watch has three basic functions to view or use:  Time. Date. Timer. Alarm.

The BOTTOM LEFT ""Mode button"" only switches between the Time and stopwatch timer but is also used to engage the setting features.

TO SET THE ALARM:

If needed, first press the Bottom Left MODE button to get to the normal Time function.

Time is always displayed with the hours at top Left screen, Minutes at top Right and seconds in the small box below minutes.

To first see what the current alarm time is, make sure you are in the normal Time Mode then press and briefly hold the BOTTOM RIGHT button.

TURNING ON / OFF THE ALARM:

To Turn ON or OFF the alarm, press and HOLD the Bottom Right Button and simultaneously press the Top Right 1x.

You will see the Alarm Bell Icon Appear or Disappear.

Press these same two buttons again to activate both the Alarm (bell symbol) and or the Hourly Audio Chirp (echo symbol).

In order to hear the Alarm, the Bell Symbol must be shown on the LCD screen. This will let you know the alarm is ON.

The secondary Audible Symbol (echo) gives a brief audio chirp at the top of each hour.

CHANGING THE ALARM TIME:

With the watch in the normal Time function mode, Depress and briefly hold the Lower Left MODE button for three (3) seconds.

Wait until the LCD display begins flashing. When it begins flashing It will first enter into the Alarm Setting mode.

It will first flash the Hours setting to change the alarm hour.

To now change the Alarm Hour, press the LOWER RIGHT button repeatedly to cycle to the desired alarm hour.

Take notice that the A and P will cycle on the lower right screen for AM (A) or PM (P) selection.

Now press the Top Right button to switch edit selection over to minutes.

Now press the Lower Right button repeatedly again to cycle to the desired alarm minutes.

You cannot change seconds so this mode only has two options of Hours and Minutes for the alarm.

When done, repress the LOWER LEFT MODE button once more and you will completely exit the alarm setting mode.

SETTING THE TIME AND DATE:

To now set the time, repress and HOLD the LOWER LEFT MODE button again until it is flashing then repress 1x for 1/2 second.

Therefore the first depress setting mode is for the Alarm. To access the Time Set, hold 3 Sec and then 1x for Time / Date set.

This will now engage the TIME SET mode.

Just as with the Alarm, use the TOP RIGHT button to select Hours, then use BOTTOM RIGHT to set hours.

Now press TOP RIGHT button again to select Minutes, then use BOTTOM RIGHT again to set minutes.

While still in this mode You can then press the TOP RIGHT button again to select the Month.

Change the month (1-12) with the LOWER RIGHT button.

press the TOP RIGHT button again to select the Day of Month.

Change the Day (Number 1-31) with the LOWER RIGHT button.

Now press the TOP RIGHT button again to select the Day of the Week (Mon, Tue, Wed, Thus, etc)

Change the Day (Word) with the LOWER RIGHT button.

To exit out of the Time / Date function at any time, repress the LOWER LEFT MODE button once.

Once completed properly you should see the current time you just set. If it is past 12 noon,

you should see a PM symbol right below the Hours indication.

Below this you should also see the abbreviation for the current day (Sun, Mon, Tu, Wed, Th, Fri, etc)

NOTE: It has also been reported that this watch may have a 12-24 hour Military time display function.
As of this tutorial posted on Oct 13, 2015 We could not find a way to access this feature on the RK5034.

TO CHECK / VIEW THE DATE:

To check the current month / day, press and briefly hold the TOP RIGHT Button.

The Calendar Month (of 12) is shown at Left, with Day of Month (of 31) shown at Right.

STOP WATCH TIMER FEATURE:

The stopwatch is a standard ""count up"" sports style timer with Lap and Reset function.

Press the MODE button (bottom left) 1x to access the Stop Watch Timer feature.

To Start the Stop Watch, press the TOP RIGHT button.

The top left displays minutes, top right seconds, and lower right (small box) in hundredths of seconds.

To Stop the Stop Watch, press the TOP RIGHT button again.

To re-start the Stop watch press the TOP RIGHT again.

While the timer is running, press the BOTTOM RIGHT to engage the LAP function.

Press the BOTTOM RIGHT again to Reset the time back to 0:00 minutes and 00 seconds.

To exit back to time, press the Bottom Left MODE button.",MANUAL FOR THE RK5034,5.0,B0000YWSL0

I waited, hoping the watch would cure itself.  It didn't. I tried to charge it. It didn't help. I read that some people take out the battery to reset it.  After a few months of having a blank screen I opened the watch.  Messing with the battery looked like too much of a job.  So, I closed up the watch and put it on the charger.  Nothing, again.  I stick the watch in a drawer for a couple months.  I put it on the charger.  Nothing.  I put in the drawer for another few months.

The huge watch is quite useless. You can get the same information easily on the net or over the radio w/o the $60 per year fee. Only works where there is the FM signal. Needs to be charged every other day. btw, you must remove it do recharge with magnetic coupled charger.

Not guaranteed to work where you live. You have a local area, so if you travel you can encure more fees like a cell phone.

The only nice thing is that you do not have to set the time (usually). Other watches do that as well. Gee, I bought an alarm clock for $14 that does the same. And, oh yeah, it gets PRI and NPR as well for the information I need within ten minutes.

"Many of the features of this device are awesome and show a clear path into the future of wrist-watches. Heaving your watch know your calendar just makes sense.

However, there are problems!

The watch simply resets itself all the time! This means that it does not keep track of time well at all, because every time it resets itself, the time of the watch goes to 2am, Jan 1st 2003. Granted, over the next few minutes, the watch re-aquires the correct time from the server, but even that does not make it OK when the watch resets itself sometimes several times within an hour.

Example: I went to the park jogging today. I tried to use the built in chronograph to see how long it took me to run my usual lap. However, within a few minutes, the watch reset itself and with it the chronograph. In all, the watch must have reset itself close to 10 times within that hour it took me to complete my lap.

And not only is this a problem for just plain time-keeping. How much do you trust calendar reminders when the watch more often than not has the wrong time? Also, you end up reading the same news over and over, since the watch looses track of what it had already downloaded. Argh!

The concept here is great. I just can not believe that MS would let such a severe bug slip into the release version of this product! And it's not just that the watch resets/reboots, but what I really do not understand is why it looses track of time in that process?!? When I reboot any other computer, the system clock does not get set back! I mean: C'mon! With all the hurdles they had to clear to make this device a reality, they could not make a watch that keeps track of time?!?

For now, I really can not recommend this product. However, once they have this bug ironed out (and the coverage area expanded), this will be one awesome device!",Great Potential but Bad Watch,2.0,B0001540G4
I bought this as a gift it's a great watch though if not worn daily it is a bit of an inconvinence because it needs to continously  be set.,automatic watch,4.0,B00015GLMK
"OK, I did my homework... researched extensively in as many web sites as I could, for reviews and ratings, and finally decided to go for it and get the watch with the most favorable reviews (Fossil, Square Face).  What a DISAPPOINTMENT!!

Seriously, the watch is scaringly ENORMOUS!! As in UNWEARABLY BIG (over 1/2 and inch thick!! 2 inches long!! 1.5 inches wide!! WOW!!!)... my wife and I actually laughed when I took it out of the box!  It looks like some kind of weapon or wearable instrument (sci-fi movie like), but definitely not like a watch.  G-Shocks are considerably smaller than these!!!  I do not know how big the other reviewers--with favorable ratings--are, but I can tell you that on a 5'7"" person like me (average height of the population in the planet, and the one used in ergonomics designs), it looks like a bad joke.  Good luck if you wear long sleeved shirts!

But, since the gargantuan thing had arrived, I decided to, at least, test its functionality. After all, that is why I got the watch on the first place.

My funcitonality test endeded when reading the MSN Direct service agreement's ""fine print"".  There are so many provisions AGAINST the user, that it is actually fun to read: they take no responsibility, whatsoever, for any service disruption or if the service does not work at all (and will charge you anyways)... they limit the number of instant messages and calendar notes AND will charge you MORE MONEY for receiving more than the limit (which is not stipulated ANYWHERE in the agreement--scary!)... there are no refunds WHATSOEVER, for any reason... there is no clarification if the ""first month free"" is the same ""trial period"" mentioned in the contract or not, so I could not tell if after testing the service for less than a month and cancelling it, I would still be charged the yearly fee (as in other services, ""first month free"" could mean that the yearly service cost is for 11 months + 1 ""free"" month... where the latter is NOT a trial period, but a package deal)... and it goes on and on... NO WAY I AM SPENDING AN EXTRA SIXTY BUCKS FOR A SERVICE I WILL POSSIBLY NEVER GET!!!

This puppy is going back to the store, I'll just wait a few more years till the technology matures and someone other than MSN, with a true concept of ""service"", offers and alternative solution.  On the meantime, back to my old, faithful Tissot and my cell phone... which together, do more than these watches ever could.","Nice idea, HUGE watch, HORRIBLE service agreement",1.0,B000153MWM

COOL!",Loved it!,5.0,B000153MWM
"Given all the negative words written about these watches, I thought I'd chime in with a positive review (and no, I do not work for Fossil or Microsoft).
I love it.  Period.  After wearing my Wrist Net Square for the past couple of weeks I can't imagine wearing a simple ""watch"" anymore.  Being able to glance at my wrist and have access to news, stocks, weather, IMs, and my Outlook calendar appointments is nothing short of amazing.  And yes, I do own a wireless-enabled PDA and cellphone, but there are plenty of times when using them is inappropriate or inconvienient.  Mind you, keeping your expectations grounded in reality is helpful.  You're not going to be receiving the entire NY Times on these watches, nor will they serve double duty as dedicated Bloomberg Stock feeds.  If, however, you're looking for quick updates and news alerts, SPOT can't be beat.  The display is crisp and clear, the backlight can double as a flashlight in a pinch, and the ability to change watch faces depending on mood/situations is a nice touch.  Of course, it also functions quite nicely as a watch, with all the usual features present: dual alarms, stopwatch/lap timer, countdown timer, dual time...
True, the band can be a bit of a pain to adjust, but it certainly doesn't require a trip to your local jeweler.  Just use a thumbtack to push the pin in, and you're good to go.  Now that mine is sized correctly, it's actually quite comfortable - and I have thin wrists for a guy, in spite of the fact that I'm six feet tall and weigh 170lbs.
My advice to potential buyers:  Don't cheap out, get a Fossil Square, Round, Dick Tracy, or Suunto.  They won't crap out on you, and at least in the case of the Square, it actually looks cool (I've never received so many compliments on a watch - and that's before people see what it does).  Also, be sure that you live in a supported area, and do not sign up for the yearly plan.  You get a free month's service, so use it.  See if the watch is useful to you before you commit to longer contract.",A LOT more than the time...,4.0,B000153MWM

"This watch is masculine, casual, sporty, and has a backlight function.

Okay, so it took me three tries to get the right watch for my husband.  I've seen many comments on-line expressing the same frustration we've experienced--the current trend in watches is...HUGE...as in the watch itself is huge!  My husband does not have big wrists/hands and cannot carry off the huge watches you find everywhere nowadays.  But, he still wants a masculine looking watch.  This fits the bill perfectly.  Also, we have grown accustomed to the ""indiglo"" feature of Timex watches--especially great when we are travelling and don't have a clock right next to our bed.

"I have owned a lot of Timex field watches, this is about middle of the road in quality. Forget the camp watches- plastic not durable and break rather easily. The higher end expedition watches are very heavy but very durable, mine just broke from a fall of 5 feet to concrete, still functions but broke off the wheel for time setting. This watch to me is a outdoor woman's field watch, as not all of us like he tiny, dainty watches that these companies make for us wild women. Reasonable size very basic functions, time & date and glow light. And a decent band for once. I would really like to find a women's style, ( not too butch not too pretty) true outdoor watch with some added functions like gps or compass that don't look quite so yucky as some of the guys watches. I actually like some of the aviator watches and others but yes they only come in jumbo wrist sizes. Some company will one day figure it out and make a killing selling fashionable functioning outdoor gear for women, still waiting. This watch only gets 4 stars, as durability is still suspect. I'm very active and my watches take a beating, so will see. The greyish face takes getting use to and the light comes off as a greenish color.

"I'm a long-time Timex Data Link watch wearer. I love the idea of having a sports watch and my data combined. I bought the first Data Link made and loved it. But when we got new LED screens, Timex opted to make it so we couldn't use the software, making the data part of the watch virtually worthless.

My original watch is still working. I liked the way you went from one contact to another. It was a simple watch and had lots of good features that were easy to use.

This current watch lasted about a year and a half and went down for good. I'm replacing it with a Timex sports watch. The watch eats batteries too.

This newer model Data Link does not have the rich features of the original. It doesn't tell you when the battery is low. It's more difficult to get from one contact to another. And, as I discovered, they don't last long. At least mine didn't. It lasted through the warranty and that's about all.

I now have contacts on my cellphone and in my Palm so, while I loved having them on the watch, I can live without it. I really need time alarms and the timing features of the sports watch.

So those are the trade offs. Did I get a lemon? It's possible. But this was my experience. I may get a Data Link again. But it will be if they really do a terrific upgrade.

By the way, Timex charges $7.00 for return shipping when you send a watch in for replacement or repair --- even when it's in warranty.",Not as good as the original - buggy,3.0,B00020J1G2

"In the past I have purchased DATALINK watches that required the Watch to be held in front of the Monitor and the Data was downloaded from the PC to the watch using an electronic eye in the watch to scan the video patterns. I find this newer version to be much more convenient as I usually upload things such as occasion or contacts on a more or less weekly basis. I use medications and I find the alarm settings for that is easy. Instructions for each type of setting are clear on the monitor and to use the watch for other titles is relatively easy for example I am not very athletic so I converted one title so I have Business Contacts and the normal Contacts are personal friends and relatives. If you need an Ipod or more extensive features by all means spend more money if you are a person with a normal amount of friends,aquaintances and family business contacts the Datalink is not expensive and suits my purpose.",DATALINK USB WATCH fits my style,5.0,B00020J1G2

I have owned my first for 23 years, my second for 19 and I get these here for friends who are not Amazon members. Lately the pin they use for the lid is not the same quality as years ago. It is not as rounded at the ends thus not as smooth and secure to open and close. Just recently repair told a friend that it would cost near $250 (retail is $265) to fix his lid. Who are they paying to do the work? It used to be that a cleaning was $35, I fear to know what it is now. The band is quite overpriced at $35 your local watch repair may not be Seiko certified, and that makes a difference to repair, but they probably have really nice band for $25. However, as the only other quality braille watch is ARSA is Switzerland and they do not respond to repair inquiries this seems to be our middle choice. Always a performer.

"I bought this watch for my cousin's birthday. It was to replace a Reizen watch I bought for him for Christmas 3 years ago. The Reizen lasted pretty long and it was not bad for a $60 watch.  In the end, the watch stopped working properly, the time was always behind even with new batteries placed.

Anyways, with this Seiko watch, I was on the fence about purchasing it due to the poor reviews. But due to my not knowing what else to buy for a birthday gift and my procrastination,  I took a gamble and bought it.
So far there are no complaints. By cousin loved this watch. The case cover is easy to open and close and the leather bands are visually impaired friendly. The way you put it on is exactly how you would put on a watch with metal bands, slip it on like a bracelet and close it with the clasp. I never seen watches with leather bands with this kind of closure. The band's are also adjustable, so if you have small wrists, no problem.
I really hope this watch lasts, but the previous reviews don't give me a lot of hope. It's been almost 2 months and so far so good for now.

"I bought this as a casual everyday watch and so far I love it.

First, it looks great. It's a midsize watch at 40mm and is really a perfect size- definitely not small but also not a trendy monster size. And it looks really sharp. Between the beige dial, dark brown leather strap, and copper/gold case, it could go with almost anyone's skin tone. And it looks classier than I thought, so I might even wear it to work.

Second, it feels great. The leather band is super comfortable. And the case is slightly curved, which means it sits better on my wrist than any non-curved watch I've worn. It is light, too, and combined with the above the watch never moves around on my wrist and feels like I'm not wearing anything.

The design is classic and masculine without trying too hard. I almost didn't buy it because I worried it was too cheap (as I remembered my Timex Expeditions from the 90's that crapped out on me). But it doesn't look or feel cheap.

He wears it all the time - hopefully because he actually likes it and not just to make me happy! No seriously it looks great. Nixon is a great brand.,Perfect Xmas Gift,5.0,B0002CP7L8

I was skeptical at first buying a watch from Inventory Adjusters but it was a good experience.  I verified the watch through Raymond Weil as authentic and registered it through there website.  The only negative is that it comes in a cheap Raymond Weil watch box and has no instructions.  When I called Inventory Adjusters they said they don't have instruction manuals ... kind of strange.  they did send me the manual on email.

"Unfortunately, this Armitron arrived from Amazon broken. The digital part worked fine, but the analog arms didn't move at all, so I had to return it. Good return service from Amazon. If the watch had been working it would have been all right. Kind of a nice design. I used to have an Armitron analog/digital that I loved, but they discontinued that excellent design, so I took a chance on another one. The negatives on this one are the plastic band (which might be hard to replace, since it's an unusual shape) and the loud beep each time you hit the button to change modes.

"plusses

+ two time zones apart from the analog time, that way you can have two alarms and one really useable alternate time zone (since the alarms are dependant on the digital time, one digital time is wasted as it would have to be exactly corresponding to the analog time)

+ I like that this does not use the crown wheel, which is supposed to be a 'feature' of many other Timexes but is actually a big pain to use.

minuses

- the digital display is a bit small and the shadow from the dial falls on it, making it a little hard to read

- the second time zone can have a different hour, date, day but not a different minute (I find this really stupid, but most Timexes have this problem)

- the strap looks cheap.

- does not have the FLIX feature.

- all alarms correspond to the digital time. This means that if you want the alarm to ring at say 7 am, your analog time and the digital time zone 1 have to be exactly the same so that when the analog time is 7 your digital time is also 7 and the alarm rings. I would have liked the alarms to correspond to the analog time alone, so that i can truly have independant time zones in the digital display. But this is problem with most combo Timexes I checked out.

- liked the black dial in the 44442 better",A good watch,3.0,B0002M9SFE

"Worst quality out of all 12 Timex Ironman watches I've owned.
Small melted spot on case looks like it touched something hot at the factory.  The START LAP button only works if you push it very hard.  The band is very scratchy and irritating.  It's like having a wool sweater on my wrist.  The IndiGlo is dimmer than any other watch I've ever owned.

I've been wearing Timex Ironman watches since 1998, and I mean 24/7.  I basically buy one and wear it all the time including showers, swimming, working (manual labor) working out, etc.  I've had them last as little as six months or as long as 2 years.  Usually by the time the strap breaks the face is all scratched up, the paint is worn off the plastic and it's just time for a new one.  A couple of times I've had water get in and ruin the watch.  Once I had the plastic casing of the watch crack.  My point is I'm an experienced purchaser and user of Timex Ironman watches and this one is the shoddiest I've ever had.  The START LAP button doesn't even work unless I mash it.

The watch looks pretty nice.  No glaring gaudy colors.  Nice silver and black.  Understated, visually.

I keep buying Timex Ironman watches because at least they have all the features I'm used to and which I use all the time.  I suppose I could just wear this one until it craps out, but it's just so uncomfortable.  The band material looks like they made it out of some kind of high tech breathable fiber but in reality it's just some kind of knitted plastic thread that feels abrasive on my arm.

"As a confirmed watchaholic, I write with the experience of owning many watches. Purchased in Sept., 2007, my Timex Chrono has been a superior watch to many I've had, costing many times more. I believe a watch must look good, show me the time and date(correctly) when asked, then go wherever my arm takes it until it's called upon again. I'm tough on my watches, careful but tough. This Timex has survived snow-blowing, lawn mowing and other home improvement projects-never skipped a beat! The crystal does not scratch easily nor does show wear. It's just as at home looking out from under a suit jacket. Not one to solicit comments from strangers, people have actually asked what kind of watch it is, they've said it looks great(and expensive), can't believe it's a Timex! That's not a bad thing, maybe they'll start thinking differently. Last thing, this Chrono will NOT be lost on your arm if you are a rather large fellow!

I expend like two weeks looking around for something like this, a crhrono watch with also a indiglo light system. So if you are looking for a great watch try this one.

"My old 5 year old Q&Q Superior needed replacement, so I looked at Timex brand (again).

Positives:
-looks good, classy and not too garish
-for smaller hands size is about perfect
-bracelet hugs wrist
-very easy to read
-shows date and time
-backlit face
-nice fit and finish
-water proof
-battery is good for 10 years
-looks more expensive that it really is

Negatives:
-a bit too thick to my taste. My older watch was only 6 mm from belly to spine
-awkward day setting. lots of knob/finger work.... Date sets easily though
-Knob positions are uncertain. You think it is set to adjust date but in reality you are changing time.
-bracelet does pinch skin/hair a bit and meant for smaller wrists.
-mechanism can be heard in very quiet surroundings.

Verdict:
Very nice watch for money. It feels and looks like quality piece. I never wore expandable bracelets before so I confess - this one feels like leather band. Watch stays put on wrist, no sliding up/down. Some hair/skin pinching is there but I guess this is inherent to bracelet design. Watch fits variety of social situations and won't look alien even with business suit. 10 year battery makes this watch one-time investment. Most watches get replaced much earlier.

All in all - this is practical, good looking and inexpensive watch. Great buy!",Excellent watch,5.0,B0002M9RX2
"I wanted to buy a little something for a friend whose only watch was digital. The T26461 was the blend I sought:

1. Accuracy. Hey, this is quartz.

2. Durability. It's a Timex, 'nuff said!

3. Nighttime readability. Indiglo!

4. Value. No one will mistake this for a luxury watch, but it's something that will last him a long time, and look decent enough with dress shirts.

Contrary to the description, the expansion bracelet is polished only on the gold tone. The rest is brushed and actually a bit dull. I buffed it a bit with my Dremel, polishing compound and cloth wheel, not to a enough to make it look classier. The bracelet is VERY SMALL, perfect for my thin friend's skeleton-like wrist, but I wonder if guys even of just average size will be too large for it.

Quartz watches ideally ship with the crown pulled out (which stops the movement), so that the battery will be as fresh as possible for the buyer. This Timex comes with a 10-year battery. Putting that in perspective, for what it costs to replace a different watch brand's battery every couple of years, you could spend almost as much as on this Timex.","Great value for a durable, basic semi-dress watch",5.0,B0002M9RX2

When I bought this I purchased a 18mm leather band for it, but this was actually too small. I returned it and bought a 19mm band instead (deBeer sport leather) which is a better fit. The brown goes well with the blue dial.

I really like the simple face and it's a nice point of interest to show off the transparent back. I have scratched the face a lil' bit, but when viewed straight on the scratch isn't noticeable. It is only a hardex glass, not sapphire.

What you see is what you get, really. A nice little (I have skinny wrists so this was a key feature for me) watch that looks good and keeps good time.

"This watch looks beautiful and it is quiet and precise. Also, it is pretty thin and comfortable. It would be perfect if there were no two issues:

1. It stopped working after two weeks. I suspected battery, so had a little trouble opening the watch.

This is what you need to do: Find small opening between the lid and the body of the watch. Use very sharp knife or small flat screwdriver (that you can use to tighten sunglasses) and open. If you do not find this small hole, there is no way to open it. BTW, battery is hard to find in electronic or pharmacy stores. After I replaced it, it works just fine. The original battery was Sony, but it is possible that the watch was in a warehouse in the box for a year or two before it was shipped to me.

"I replaced a 16 year old Wenger watch (same model) with this one. It had been completely reliable until the knob for manually changing time went off alignment and wouldn't work anymore

Note: the size of the watch is substantial.  My old one was the ladies' version which was nearly as large as a regular dress watch for men. This one is the men's size... it's quite large, which makes reading time (especially at night) much easier for my now bifocal-using eyes :)

The phosphorescent dots on the dial 'charge up' in a couple of minutes and last a long time in the dark.

the only drawback on this watch design is the date number counter:  you have to manually set it every other month.

Tip: you can change the battery yourself and save $$$ (note: if you have the battery changed at a dept store, for 9-15$, the warranty will be voided just the same as if you do it yourself).

"I felt in necessary to add a review to the listing, although it's an out of date watch and you cannot find this review from searching via Amazons own search function but here goes.

I received this watch as a gift a few years ago.  The battery is dead.

Go to Seiko's Website: there is NO search feature to find the proper battery size
Go to Seiko's Website: there is no ability to download any information about older models, such as a little help with the PROPER way to open the watch back

Now the Function: Clearly the fools who designed this watch don't care about function.  Let us see, you want to set the alarm, pull the stock out and set it but while your setting it the clock stops and the time gets messed up. You want to the alarm frequently?  Like daily, well you can pull the stock out and set it daily. Like that is really good for the seal for the 200m water proof feature. Nice going Seiko.

It's a inexpensive watch and is basically a throw out when the battery is dead. So I threw it out.

I'll stick with my cell phone for a clock/watch or my beeper.

Oh and by the way as far as Battery Websites are concerned: Try looking up a battery for a watch by brand or model number...good luck with that

"This watch is very nice looking, lightweight and undoubtedly reliable and accurate since it's a Seiko.  The chronograph (stopwatch) style with 3 subdials and a date window is a classic look, and currently in vogue even though it is a bit cluttered.

From a purely functional standpoint, there are drawbacks to this layout.  As is true on many subdial chronongraphs, the chronograph minute dial is small and hard to read.  This one especially, since it reads a full 60 minutes on a single subdial and is rather small.  It is also frequently covered by the hands of the primary dial.  I found it almost impossible to read it to the exact minute.  Also, it accumulates only to 60 minutes before starting over, so timing multi-hour intervals is a problem.  A standard scuba diving bezel is about equally functional, as easy to use and can be read at a glance.  Because of these drawbacks, I returned the watch.  However, for timing intervals of less than one minute, the chronograph works perfectly and is very easy to use and read because it uses the main dial for that.

The alarm function is a bit tedious to set, but curiously it can be made to function as a second timezone dial when the alarm is inactive.  I was not impressed by the comfort of the bracelet (a bit of a hair-puller on me), but the watch case will accept any standard 20 mm strap and looks great on a black nylon or dive strap.

Overall, I would say to buy it if you are buying it primarily for its great looks, and the alarm/chrono functions are secondary or unnecessary.  This is probably true for the majority of users anyway.  If you really need alarm or chrono functions, either use the ones in your cell phone or consider a different watch (preferably a digital one).","Looks great, but Chrono is hard to read",4.0,B00068TJLC
"I really love my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Seiko-Men-s-Alarm-Chronograph-Titanium-Watch-SNA139/dp/B00068TJLC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Seiko Men's Alarm Chronograph Titanium Watch #SNA139</a>.  In fact, even though I own several more expensive watches (and plenty of cheaper ones too) this one has by far become one of my favorites.  I have owned this watch for well over 2 and 1/2 years at this point and I'm sure that the warrantee will run out before it ever has a problem.  In fact I have never even had to change a battery.

For starters, the most important feature of any good watch is the ability to tell time. Unlike several other watches I own in this price range, the Seiko excells here.  I can't provide exact measurements because the time variance has been that low, on the order of perhaps seconds per month.

When it comes to watches in this price range, most of them are steel and as a result MUCH heavier.  The titanium band and casing result in a very light watch, it almost feels like it's not even there.

Yet having work my watch during some grueling long distance runs as well as carpentry work, I can honestly say this watch is very durable.  I have had the misfortune to have this watch smacked against by others, and while I do have one small scratch on the bezel it is minimal in light of how long I've had this watch.

The chronograph feature of the watch works nicely.  I consider it an extra, because it's not the primary reason I would have bought this watch.  It will certainly do in a pinch, but I suppose heavy chronograph users might need more intervals than this provides.

I personally like the black face, but if you need a white face the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Seiko-Men-s-Alarm-Chronograph-Titanium-Watch-SNA379/dp/B00068TJJE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Seiko Men's Alarm Chronograph Titanium Watch #SNA379</a>&nbsp;appears to be the same watch with the white face.  The picture also let's you get a better sense of the two toned band than this one.

The only down-side is the alarm function, which is virtually unusable.  It works in 12 hour intervals which is not very practical.  And if you can figure out how to set it, it certainly isn't loud enough to be used to wake most people up.

Still other than the alarm function, everything else about this watch is really nice.

Let's be honest here, those of us buying Seiko watches want a good reliable watch at an affordable price.  We are not the Omega, Rolex and Patek-Philippe owners of the world.  If we were we probably would never buy Seiko.  Yet I am glad that my limited means have led me to this watch, which is truly the best in it's class.

If you are in search of a reliable watch that is both light and durable, you have found it.  Particularly if you find steel watches too heavy, this is a nice performing and light watch that you won't even feel on your wrist.  As long as you can live without the alarm feature, this is one of the best watches you can buy in the $200 price range.

Enjoy.","Seiko Men's Black Dial Chronograph 139 - Great Watch, only One Flaw",4.0,B00068TJLC
I needed a watch with an alarm that was thin and light so I could wear it under my motorcycle riding gloves.  The Seiko SNA139 is made of titanium and met all my requirements exactly.  The only complaint is that the manual makes no mention of the fact that the crown is threaded and must be unscrewed to pull the crown out to make adjustments.  I was about to return the watch as defective had it not been for the excellent advise given by WatchZone.  The crown is threaded to provide a tight seal that is waterproof to 200 meters.  Most watches are only waterproof to 100 meters.  Great watch!,"Great watch, terrible manual!",5.0,B00068TJLC

I had the watch hands aligned and the time set in less than ten minuets.
That was about a month ago and the watch is keeping perfect time. My only resevation would be the soft tone of the alarm. It needs to be a bit louder.

"Bought this watch a couple months ago, used but in excellent condition. Because it was used, I only paid less than a fourth of the price listed here. And to be honest, if I had found this watch nib at the ""new watch price,"" I would have simply glanced over it and passed it by.

That said, here's my review on this Seiko's quality-- in a word, it's ""excellent."" While it garners attention from others because of it's good looks, mechanically it keeps excellent time and all the chrono functions work very well. I absolutely love the blue hands against this watch's white face. Honestly, it was the uniqueness of the blue hands that was the largest ""selling point"" for me.

The only thing that I hope Seiko has changed on newer models (since this one's been discontinued) is the alarm. It's simply too weak-sounding to be of any real use. If I were to try to use it during the day, it would most likely get lost in all the ambient noise around me. If I were to use it to as a morning alarm, I doubt very much that it could wake me from any sort of decent sleep.

The bottom line: this is a good, quality watch if you can find it at a similar price to what I paid. At the price being asked here, move on and don't give it another thought.",This watch is aweseome...,4.0,B00068TJL2

"I was looking for a watch that I would feel comfortable wearing to business engagements and yet still not feel over-accessorized walking though The Home Depot. This watch came up numerous times in searches in Amazon. The criteria I was looking for was 1) sapphire crystal, 2) multi-faced dial, 3) not too flashy, and 4) price. The biggest problem with the typical ""fashionably sporty"" watch is that the faces are too big or too thick or simply contrasts too much with the band. I dislike black faced dials on a polished bezel and band. This watch had it all.

The watch is of the utmost quality. You could go to Macy's and pay $400 for this same watch. The band is nicely polished and the clasp is typical Seiko, that's good. The hands are all aligned perfectly in the 12 position and adjustable if they're not. Mine were not out of the box. The hands are actually blue, but provides a nice hint of color on an otherwise bland face, very appealing. There is a nice weight to the watch. Its actually lighter than other similarly sized steel watches I've had.

There is no light, so previous reviewers comments on after-hours time checks are accurate. The hands are typical luminescent hands. They hold the light for 20 minutes maybe. You won't be waking up at night to check the time on this time piece, but that's why you have an alarm clock.

The deciding factor for me was the sapphire crystal. It was a must. I'm not one to spend $500 on a watch because I'm very hard on them. A mineral crystal is simply too easily scratched. I liked some of the Citizen designs, but simply won't spend that kind of money for a mineral crystal. For Seiko quality, with a sapphire crystal under $150 this is a steal.  Overall, I'm very happy; 5 stars.","Elegant, yet sporty enough everyday use",5.0,B00068TJL2

"My Seiko SGF709 died today.  It's rather sad because it has been with me since April 4, 2001.  That surpasses any other watch I have ever owned by at least 5 yrs.  Up until today, it always stayed within a second a month accuracy unless the battery need changing. Sitting here looking at the watch, I see that it has some minor scratching on the crystal.  The gold tone ribs on the band are no longer gold tone, just a matching titanium grey.  Guess I forgot that they ever were gold tone until I started looking at a replacement.  The titanium case and band do not show any scratches or dings, though I won't mention the black crud that has accumulated in some of the crevices of the band.  We have had some exciting times together, digging post holes, painting, mechanicing, fishing, hunting and swimming. I seldom take it off, and it has absorbed all the abuse.  Just last year I accidently ripped it off my arm lowering the outboard motor on the boat.  It took me over 30 minutes to find it in the mud on the bottom of the lake.  A new pin in the band and it was as good as new.  So you ask ""Will you buy another one?""  NO.

"I bought this watch 5 months ago and I'm wearing it daily since then. I particularly enjoyed its looks and the fact that it's thin and lightweight. It keeps accurate time and there's still no scratch on the glass.

The watchband is not so ""junk"" as other reviewers say, but it's not of very high quality either. Note that the golden strips on the watchband go only for about half of its length, which I find a bit strange. Also note that, for someone used with steel watches, it feels a bit strange the first time wearing a titanium watch. It is lighter, sounds different and feels cheap (or not well assembled). This is not the case, and when I got used to it I really found it much nicer than a steel watch (besides being lightweight it also reaches body temperature quicker).

I did not need a pin remover for adjusting the watchband (in fact, the links are not made with cylindrical ""pins"" for this watch, and a pin remover would be pretty much useless, I think). The watchband can be easily adjusted with a small screwdriver and a bit of force, by pushing the links from the inside.

The seconds hand does not align on the tick marks. For my watch, it comes quite mid-way between two consecutive ticks, but it's not something that I really care about.

It simply looks fantastic, is nicely heavy without being overweight and is the best gift I have been given in a long time.

"As the other reviewers have said, this watch has a lot going for it, so I won't repeat what they have already mentioned. Generally, it's a unique, well built watch from a good company. But.....

There are however, two annoyances. 1) The silver matte finish scratches too easily, and they can't be buffed out without further damaging the finish.

2)The band is only adjustable by removing entire links; there is no ""micro-adjustable"" clasp. Since the links are large, if it's a little too small, adding a whole link will make it way too loose. I initially removed two links and it was tight enough to leave a slight impression on my wrist. When I added one link, it's so loose it flops around. Even cheap watches have clasps that can be adjusted a millimeter at a time by moving a pin in different holes. That type of adjustable clasp in addition to removing links makes for a perfect fit. Unfortunately, this nice watch will likely be too big or too small, and there is nothing you can do about it. Seiko didn't even put half-links in the band for a more accurate fit.

I would give it 3 stars for such a glaring (and annoying) design oversight, but this is such an awesome watch it gets extra credit!",Eye Catching Watch,4.0,B00068TK8Y

"This Seiko watch makes a great gift. It comes in a gorgeous deep blue box with the watch wrapped around a little white Seiko pillow.  The watchface is every bit as impressive as the photos indicate.  Unfortunately, the metal band is no where nearly as sexy as the photos would have you believe.  The photos show a clear difference between the shiny and matte metal parts.  In real life, the difference isn't so obvious.  To be completely honest, outside of the fantastic watch face, I think this watch comes off looking a little cheap. So when you fall in love with the watch based on the photos (like I did), don't be disappointed when the watch you receive isn't quite so spectacular.",Increible Seiko quality.

I don't wear it in the house as to not tear it up. I have an office job so it's gently used. The only problem I had with it is the initial winding. I was wearing it every day and walking about 1 mile and a half a day to and from work and it was not fully charged for some time. The manual indicated it would have been fully charged in a day or two. I thought something was wrong and returned it. I got a replacement which did the same thing. Once it was charged it was good. I went to Iraq for 6 months and it was dead when I got back even though the manual says it will stay 6 months. But other wise it's held a charge well.

"I just purchased one of these watches and I like it a lot. However, it is really designed for righthanders. If you are a lefty, you usually wear your watch on your right wrist. The massive crowns of the Invicta watches cut into the back of the hand and are somewhat uncomfortable. If you bend your hand back, the crown leaves a distinct impression. The other thing is the date window is located in the wrong spot for a lefty. It should be by the number 8 on the dial and not the 4. Admittedly, these may be minor points but I also have an oversize Invicta Corduba watch with a right crown that I like better. I guess I'll just purchase right handed Invictas instead.

"I've had this watch for the last 3 years, wore it nearly everyday.  Great Watch, durable,and has stayed looking great through a lot of hard military duty abuse.  The only problem, is that the band has finally cracked and broken, and finding a replacement band is impossible.  I have looked everywhere, called everywhere, including Pulsar, and have been unable to find a replacement band for any cost at all.  Essentially a great watch that has been deemed useless.  Off brand replacements do not fit the watch because of it's wide, curved band, and heavy weight.  Unfortunately I am going to be switching to a Luminox from here on out.

I'm editing this now, months later, and another user has linked below where to find the replacement band.  With the new band on order, I am very much satisfied with this watch.  It still works perfectly, and I am looking forward to wearing it regularly again.  The watch is solid, and as an afterthought, I do believe that part of the reason the band wore out in only a few years, is largely due to the alcohol in hand sanitizers used at the hospital I worked at.  I imagine it dried out the rubber too much.

All in all, I'm very happy with the watch.","Great Watch, good luck finding a replacement band",4.0,B0006Q4ERI

This is a large, thick and heavy watch. So much so, that I find its weight on my wrist annoying.  But the worst ""feature"" is that the crystal scratches if you merely look at it wrong. My watch developed noticeable scratches after the first 24 hours of wear. In contrast my 7 year old Pulsar Solar still looked great (and scratch free) up until I managed to accidentally destroy its crystal.

Two negatives I find in the watch is one: that you can only roughly size the band by removing or adding links....it has no fine adjustment at the clasp. Second: it is has a snap-on rather than screw-on backplate and thus only water resistant to 3 atmospheres or 100 feet.

"I purchased this watch explicitly to keep track of time while writing the LSAT (recent regulations restrict timing devices to analog watches).  Unfortuantly, one major frustration with this watch comes from the reseting of the chronograph.  While most analog choronographs I have seen have the minute and second hand snap to zero in under 2 seconds (some completing a rotation), this watch takes nearly 2 minute to reset!  I'm not sure why, but the second hand literally unwinds once for each minute you have timed.  In other words, if you clock 30 minutes, it needs to unwind 30 times.  This is very frustrating if you need to stop and reset instantly (as you need to between the successive 35 minute sections of the LSAT). The good news is that past 30 minutes, the second hand unwinds forward (so at 45 minutes, the second hand unwinds 15 times, not 45 times.

Other than that, the only criticism I would have is the physical size of case.  It is nearly 1/2 an inch thick! This makes it easy to catch on things, and hard to slip under a shirt sleeve.

Other things to keep in mind: Some descriptions say the chronograph has hr, min, sec, and 10th seconds... this is incorrect.  The chronograph is only min, sec, and 10th seconds--the hr display subdial is a 24 hr clock.

All-in-all, if you don't mind a large case, this watch seems like it would be great for timing sport events and is a sort of funky-looking watch.  Just be aware of the abnormally long reset time of the chronograph!",Long reset time for Chronograph!,3.0,B00073G91Y

I am very satisfied with the watch. It looks great and feels just right- not too heavy and not too light. The dial is dark but still you can see the hands quite well even when it is not so light. The only thing I have to warn you against is that the links of the wrist band are quite big and I couldn't manage a very comfortable size. I have managed to keep it without scratches so far without much ado. Most of the casing is brushed steel and that makes it easier not to scratch. I can't comment on the battery life which is something that I am a little worried about since this is a model from 2005. Mine was made somewhere in the beginning of 2005.

"After having worn leather-band watches for years, I wanted to to get a little more stylish by choosing a metal-band watch but was afraid I would not achieve the same comfort with a metal watch.
I am happy to say that this Kenneth Cole watch sits on my wrist perfectly and is actually more comfortable than the leather-band watches I have owned.
In addition to comfort, the watch is obviously stylish, as the photo above depicts, and it is very easy to read the time even when it is relatively dark, thanks to the silver watch background and the luminescent white strips integrated into the watch hands.  Finally, having the date on the watch is a welcome addition that I have not had on any of my current watches.

The only con I can list is the band. It feels tremendous, and it's a perfect fit for this watch. Unfortunately, the little rubber piece that holds the loose end of the band in place broke off, and it's very expensive to get a replacement through the manufacturer.

Other than that, I LOVE this watch, and plan on wearing it more once I get my band replaced.",What a beautiful timepiece!,4.0,B00028CHHO
"The design of this watch is really sleek and its visual presence is quite stunning as well. It has 3 modifiable dials controlled by the 2-position knob to set the day of the week and the date, and the 3rd dial displays military time although I have not tinkered with that at all. One additional feature that would have been nice is a light, although I see myself primarily wearing this watch to work in the day so its not that big of a deal. The linked band is also nice and the face does not sit too high off of the wrist. A great simple watch for its low price tag.","A really nice, albeit basic watch.",4.0,B0000YJ64M

"I've had my eye on this watch for awhile. Even though I prefer round faces, something about this watch just really caught my attention. It also had all the features I wanted: chronograph, alarm, date, big numbers around the dial, and water resistant. And, on top of all that, it was inexpensive enough that I could actually afford it!

The dial is just the right size, even for my small (5.5 inch) wrist. I don't like how dainty many women's watches look, but it is hard to find a men's watch which isn't too big. This is a nice compromise. Big enough to be a looker, but it isn't swallowing my wrist whole. The band did need to be adjusted, of course, which I did with this:<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SE-Watchband-Link-Remover-Tool/dp/B001F295SA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SE Watchband Link Remover Tool</a>. I took out four links, and it fits well enough. I wish I could take out another half link, but it isn't a big deal. I may eventually replace the band with a leather one. Time will tell.

The chronograph function is nice and works smoothly. I'm still learning how to do some of the more complicated stuff, like split timing, but the basics are easy to grasp.

The alarm function is nice. In addition to being an alarm, if you don't currently have it set to go off, you can change the subdial to an alternate time zone. The instructions will tell you to set it to the current time displayed by your primary watch hands, but you can deviate from this and change the alarm dial to whatever time you want. This is handy for traveling and whatnot.

The watch itself has substantial weight to it, especially the case. Some other folks have indicated that it looks cheap up close. This isn't the case; at least, not for the one I received. The band is just meh, nothing special, but serviceable, and it was the watch face itself I liked.

Overall, I'd highly recommend this watch to anyone who wants features like the chronograph and alarm but doesn't want to spring lots of money for it. It's a great starter watch.","Nice watch, great value",5.0,B00070OWV6
"I'm revieing the white face version with gold accents (crown, pushers, hands, subdial trim) which is no longer listed on Amazon.

Contrary to some other reviews, this is a great watch.  What really holds it back is the sub-par quality and design of the band.  The watch itself is hefty and of solid build quality.  There is nothing about the casing, crown, crystal (likely Hardlex, not just glass), or chrono pushers that indicates to me any less than traditional Pulsar quality (i.e. just a small step down from their sister Seiko).

The band, however, is not up to the same quality as the watch itself.  It does feel light compared to the watch body.  The links feel like folded metal instead of solid even though I can't see any lines or seams.  The brushed sections look scratched more than brushed and the polished sections look like thinly plated pot metal.  The clasp design also doesn't allow for small adjustments, meaning you can only adjust the length in increments of a full length.

The saving grace of this watch is its combination of price (as low as $35 on sale) and the straight bottom of the casing which allows you to put ANY 20mm band you like on it.  I'll likely go with an alligator style leather band with deployment clasp.  Even with the replacement band I'll have an extremely classy watch (even more formal than with the metal band) while retaining the functionality of a full chrono and alarm.",Stylish and inexpensive watch only held back by cheap band.,4.0,B00070OWV6
"I'm not a watch connoisseur but own several. Up close, this watch looks inexpensive; it also weighs a ton. It's extremely shiny and the band looks like a thin, plated metal rather than stainless steel. The black face has a stylish look from afar, but the watch looks like a bad knock off in close proximity. Quality workmanship that I associate with the Pulsar brand influenced my purchase decision. However, this watch looks like it is of lower quality than the probably $75 Fossil watch that I received as a present. On appearance alone, I don't recommend this watch nor would I wear it in public.",Looks inexpensive and weighs a ton,2.0,B00070OWV6

Wearing the watch a few days a week is more than enough to keep it happily charge.  Also, it will retain its charge and accurate time for up to 6 months with no movement.

"I bought this watch as a gift.  I liked the idea of never needing a battery.  It has the see through case back that is great for the guy who likes gadgets.  It is extremely heavy (which my boyfriend didn't like).  It looked very nice in the box but, once my boyfriend took it out and started setting the time and pushing on the button that checks the charge, we found that it was not put together very well.  The button that is pushed to check the charge can easily be pulled out.  It feels cheap.  I would not have expected such poor quality from Seiko.  It is a very heavy, large watch but the button and some black parts on the sides of the case feel like plastic.  I was not impressed with this watch at all.

"I've used Casios for many years and after the last one died after only two years, I started searching for a nice looking watch for a reasonable price.  After eliminating countless models from Casio through Heuer, I rediscovered Timex, a brand I hadn't bought in 20 years.

I was concerned about the watch's face and band being too blue, but the color is quite dark.  The light blue accents on the band look good.  So far the case and glass face are quite durable.  I paid something like $38--I would have trouble getting a metal cased Casio for this money.

expecting to find a subpar wristwatch that was not as nice as described. To my amazement, the watch was amazingly well made and designed. Mine had the croc strap that would be difficult
to replace. I was able to adjust the strap to a size that would fit my large wrist. A friend of mine saw the watch and immediately wanted one also. I told him about the deal and he ordered the watch immediately. He did not like the leather strap so he ordered a s/s band from SWI. The strap cost more than he paid for the watch. It was a mesh design and although it looked ok on him, it wasn't something I would wear.
I got many comments on the watch when I wore it and it kept perfect time for an automatic.

The main reason that I purchased this watch was to add some rose gold to my watch collection.  My disappointment, and the reason for the rating of only three stars out of five, is with the rose gold plating on this watch.  The plating is very poorly done, and uneven to say the least around the face of the watch itself.  Right around the face you notice the rose gold is much lighter in color than where the band meets the plating.  Some parts have a ""distressed"" look, while others (such as the buckle for the band) are shiny.  This might not be too noticeable to others, but it is all I see whenever I look at the watch now.  In my opinion, it is not worth the $279.99 Amazon was listing this watch for when I purchased it.  I certainly hope that anyone who paid retail in a store for this watch received one with better plating!

Might just be the one I received, so I am not going to tell anyone to avoid buying this watch.  Unfortunately I cannot recommend it, either.",A little disappointed in this watch...,3.0,B0006GN9MO
"I bought this watch for my brother, who is now a pilot and watch collector. I received the watch on time and I must say it is beautiful. It is not a watch I have seen many places and it has a very unique design. The perfect addition to my brother's collection. I love waiting for the little plane to fly by. Very sleek and even though I'm sure he may have wanted the black and red version of this one, I much prefer the blue and white. It really makes it stand out.",Beautiful and Interesting,5.0,B0002E7T7G
"nice watch,,, however in the product description it said that the band material was made of plastic and its actually made out of a cloth type material. the watch itself looked as if it was a couple of years old lying with the seller. the battery worked for a couple of hours and stopped the day i got it. disappointed that i have to change the battery now....","nice watch, dead battery",3.0,B0001F6E5Y

"Watch is a bit larger than I thought.  I have a thin, boney wrist, and removed the only two removable links on the bottom side of the face, but it still sits too far to the top side when clasped. Wish I could remove one more on the bottom side so it would be tighter.  When the band moves on my arm it tends to catch hairs in the deep recess between the outer links.  The center row of mirror-polished stainless steel links in the band get scratched in everyday wear.  But... watch looks nice even though not totally comfortable.  Quality of watch and crystal seems good.","Nice looking, but..",4.0,B0000YBNN4

"People always comment on this watch when they see it.  The mesh band stands out, and on closer inspection everyone loves the slim profile.  I do too - when you're wearing dress shirts, it slides under the cuff without catching.  The design is simple but elegant, and the face is easy to read.  My only complaint is about the crystal, which in my opinion scratches easily.  Take care not to wear it outside the office and I'm sure you'll be fine.  If you like some weight on your wrist, this is definitely not the watch for you.  If you like something unobtrusive but still eye-catching, it's hard to go wrong.",Classy watch and a great value.,4.0,B0002UD54Q

"I ended up having to give this watch to my husband (I bought it for myself).  The face of the watch is what I expected, but the band is huge and I must have spent about an hour trying to adjust it, which was virtually impossible.  I gave the watch to my husband - the band was too large for him (and he is six feet tall and medium build)!  Being mechanically inclined, my husband also tried diligently to adjust the band, to no avail.  So, overall the purchase was a waste of money due to the Fort Knox-like nature of the (non)""adjustable"" band.","""womens"" watch??",2.0,B00020J0QS
"I've had this watch for 10 years now and I still get compliments on it to this day! It's a stand out watch with a clean look, but a unique design that catches the eye. That's what drew me to this watch originally. The watch is comfortable to wear, with a good amount of weight to know it's on, but not too much to make it a burden. The band/clasp are solid construction and after 10 years of wearing this, they still work great.

In 10 years, I've replaced the hard flex crystal lens 3 times due to scrapes and scratches from me banging it on to stuff. The Face, surround, and band are all in good shape (no faux silver paint here!). And the best part of all, no battery changes! The kinetic systems works very well and has never let me down. Still holds a full ""charge"" to this day. I plan on wearing this watch for a couple more years before I finally retire it and move on to something fresh, but until then, I don't go anywhere without this and I wear it for all occasions. If it becomes available for sale again, I highly recommend it, assuming I don't buy a 2nd one just because... :)",10 years and still a eye catcher!,5.0,B00068TK52

"When I first received this watch, it was not keeping good time.  After returning for warranty service, it now keeps excellent time.  After 40 days with no adjustment, it is only 3 seconds slow.  This is amazingly accurate for a mechanical movement.  Using an auto winder when not being worn, seems to help the accuracy as it is regulated to a fuller charge.  It will tend to run a bit fast at a low charge.  This would be a five star review had the watch worked this well initially.",Much improved after warranty repairs.,4.0,B0002DRNNW
"If you like pilot watches and want a solid piece built by a reputable brand, this Fortis fits the bill. I didn't get mine from Amazon so check on the warranty information before considering a purchase. I bought an anniversary version of their GMT Spacematic and because of that it has some extra writing on the dial and a special design on the case back. Other than that, the only thing that differentiates this model is that this lacks the GMT function (if you want that it is a nice function to have and can be found at a similar price to what is currently listed). The sandblasted case/bracelet give it a soft, subtle feel that I really like as it contrasts some of my polished-steel watches. Lastly, it is by no means a small watch, but the case wears slightly smaller than most 40mm watches and the unique angled lugs make it looke good even on smaller wrists. I have had it for about a month and it is running at about +9 seconds per day. It is regular and within the standards of what an automatic of this quality/price range should be at (the movement is ETA).",Great watch!,5.0,B0002DRNNW

"Its alright.  This is my Third Kenneth Cole watch.  They are usually pretty nice and always go on sale so they are kind of hard to beat for looks.  My previous two were also black band watches and I was happy with their quality other than the fact that they both seemed to drain batteries pretty quickly.  This one is probably my least favorite yet.  It just looks kind of cheap.  The silver body just looks like a very cheap metal coated with some chrome-ish paint.  The numbers appear to be made of the same somewhat tacky material.  The band is also not as nice as other KC watches I have owned and after a few weeks, its still very stiff.  On the positive side, I do like the general design of the watch and it is extremely quiet (I find loud-ticking watches very distracting).  I wouldn't buy it again and I would be pretty disappointed had a paid the full price (I got it for 45 or $50).  Still, its just not very good quality and I wish I had spent an extra $20 to find a better watch on sale.  I gave it 3 stars but its really more like 2.5.  Search for Seiko watches instead.  They are often on sale on amazon and are a much better build.",Kenneth Cole Men's Strap watch #KC1226,3.0,B000652KUW

"WE LOVE THIS WATCH...THE ONLY TWO COMMENTS I HAVE ARE THESE:
1. THE BACK DOES NOT ALLOW FOR ENGRAVING TOO EASILY AND THERE IS NO LID SO YOU HAVE TO SQUEEZE YOUR ENGRAVED WORDS BETWEEN THE RATHER LARGE ""KENNETH COLE"" NAME WHICH IS ENGRAVED ON THE BACK.
2. THE CHAIN CONNECTOR, A ""U"" SHAPED DEVICE PULLED OUT EASILY FROM THE BASE OF THE TOP OF THE WATCH...WE HAD TO PUT IT BACK TOGETHER SO WE COULD RECONNECT THE CHAIN. MY FATHER IS ELDERLY, AND IN A NURSING HOME AND HAS TO HAVE THE CHAIN FUNCTIONING PROPERLY OR HE WOULD LOSE THE WATCH.
