"The jeans are fine, the packaging for shipment was fine. Amazon did publish the retail price in this instance so that I knew what sort of discount I was getting. I have seen a trend with Amazon though where the item, even new, has the retail price deleted so that if their partner vendors are charging a premium, one doesn't immediately know it. I've curtailed buying from Amazon until I'm convinced they won't be doing this any more. They're only response to the issue was to tell me to return the item to the vendor which is a cost to me-time and money-might as well go to a brick and mortar store if I'm going to go through that inconvenience.",jeans,4.0,B0000CBALZ

"Levi's tend to dominate the jean market for no apparent reason other than hype over the name. Fortunately, there is Wrangler that provides a less expensive, quality product (no I don't have any affiliation with Wrangler). These jeans are comfortable and sized perfectly. My only complaint is the denim of the front pocket inserts seem a little undersized. This sometime causes the white lining to show a little when you are sitting down.

"Before wearing Wrangler Pants, The only jeans I would wear were Levi's 501 button fly.  But wearing the Wrangler Carpenter Jeans gave me the option of keeping my cell phone in the side leg pocket.  The last time I went to the store, they only had one pair left; and it was darker than I preferred, but I needed some more pants, so I got it.  I thought to look online and was happy to find Amazon had them; and in the right lighter shade of blue.  I tried them on this morning for the first time.  At first everything was cool.  The comfortable; even though slightly new.  But when I was ready to leave for work, I couldn't get my phone in the pocket. WoW!  I couldn't believe these pants' pocket was too narrow.  I will never buy these pants; before physically trying them on first, again!

Pros:  The fabric weight is compatible with Florida temperatures. The back pockets are deep enough to hide my dollar bill length wallet. The larger tool pocket will accept my cell phone, a Samsung Convoy.

Cons: The smaller tool pocket is not deep enough for anything except items you won't mind losing. I cut off the hammer loop as serving no useful purpose to anyone, including carpenters. If you know one that is still employed, ask them.",Wrangler Rugged Wear Carpenter Jean,4.0,B0000CBAMK

"Get the Knee pad inserts. Bought my first pair 3 years ago, rotating with 3 other pairs, I got good life out of them in a welding environment. Biggest weak point is a product of hang the tape measure on the pocket instead of the belt, which wears out the edge much faster. Another brand has addressed this issue by adding a bit of leather. The best update with these pants is enlarging the opening at the bottom of the double knees to make insertion of the padding much easier.

"These things are amazingly warm for their thickness.  I have these and a couple sets of the Cross Country pants, and I'm extremely pleased with both. This are lightweight, can be worn indoors, and have open, not zip, pockets (this might be important to someone buying them as a running pant).  I use them running, hiking, primarily but also when weightlifting in an unheated basement.  For hiking, be aware they are not really for off trail, the fabric would snag too easily.

The sizing comment in the review is dead on, Sporthill's XXL is everyone else's XL.  I talked with the manufacturer about this, they were apparently unaware of it.  The pants are loose, but not enough to make up for undersizing.

I haven't had any problems washing them as the one review describes.  You don't want to put them in the dryer, but they readily air dry. Actually, thinking about it, these may be able to go in the dryer and the other ones can't, but I air dry them regardless as I just don't put my Sporthill stuff in the dryer in general.

Now as an avid cyclist, I figured I'd give these a try again, having forgotten about them and after a few minutes On-Line, I was excited to find out they were still in business. I was pretty excited to have another pair since I used to ""live in"" SportHills. I placed my order, and wore these around after work for a few days- they seemed a little on the short side, but what the heck- I tossed the packaging. So I washed them on gentle with my cycling kits and put them on again this weekend. I took a closer look...one leg is a full inch shorter than the other. I couldn't believe it. I even laid them down and double checked, yep. Even my wife said...""one leg is shorter"". True disappointment-Pretty pathetic quality check. What a waste of money.

"These are great track pants.  The material is a soft fine synthetic knit and fitment is great--neither baggy nor super tight.  Form-fitting.  I use these for running and biking.  Love the tapered legs with spandex band on the ends and zipper (although not needed).  My only gripe is the sizing.  Based on the Sporthill size chart, I bought Medium Long.  I am 6', 185lb and usually just buy medium pants.  The Medium Long was about 2"" too long!  Still doable since the form fitting allows for some bunching but unless regular pants are too short or you like wearing your pants above your hips rather than on your hips, I would recommend plain mediums (or the your size but without ""short"" or ""long"").  Now some men have really beefy legs--I would not recommend these pants to you.  In terms of tapered track pants, these are the most form-fitting I have tried on.  If I had massive legs, they would be tights, not just pants.

I have purchased many Dickies Shirts in the past. They were great shirts and lasted forever. I knew my size and figured it wouldn't be a problem purchasing them on line. It took forever for them to be shipped and when I got them they were horrible.  They were the same kind of shirt I had purchased in the past but the quality and size was not the same. These shirts although sized as x-large were much bigger.  I would have to gain a 100lbs to for them to fit. The length was also much longer and the material much thinner.  I was very disappointed not just at Dickies but at the company that sold them and at Amazon as well.

I purchased the jacket for hiking is long the Skyline Drive in Virginia. The outer layer blocks the wind while the sweatshirt long keeps you warm. The Velcro on the cuffs allows for individual adjustment and comfort. Love all the pockets inside and out  to store things while hiking. Note on sizing: these are unisex and run large.

The damning issue for us is the zipper. It's awful. It never works without a lot of fidgeting. We joke that we have to swear at the stupid thing before it will actually go up. Hate those zippers.

I wore it to a football game, layered over a shirt and light wool sweater and I was very comfortable sitting still for 3 hours in 37 degree weather.

Pros-
Cute color (Looks like baby pink, which is one of my favorite colors.)
Cuddly and soft
Easy to layer under heavier coats
Great for chilly snuggle weather
Great for wearing to class on SUPER lazy days

Cons-
A lot bigger than anticipated (The small seems like a medium.)
Seems like it will pill fast, but I'll have to wait and see

"Updated Review: Did they change the description recently to say ""men's""?? I eventually got a small sweatshirt, which is nice and normal in every way (except maybe the puffy sleeves, which aren't very warm). Then my partner bought me another small in a different color and.. Ugh. The 2nd small sweatshirt is very different: absurdly small neck hole, tighter shoulders or ? that makes the sleeves ride up my arms so that the wrist bands feel scratchy and too tight. I suppose for this price you sacrifice quality control.

There is no way any human body would fit in the small sweatshirt but have a neck the size of a small boy. It's not like a turtle neck, just very small and tight - ridiculous! So I removed the neck ribbing, and it looks like a new manufacturer spec'd the neck hole for the size WITH the ribbing, as the new ribbing-removed hole is the exact size of the hole of the first sweatshirt WITHOUT ribbing removed. Won't buy one again, and bummed that my new sweatshirt is now raggedy and can't be worn out of the house.
----
Looking again at the main page for this sweatshirt - it's apparently unisex. The model is a dummy after all. In any case, as a woman who normally wears between a medium and large shirt (have to go larger because of shoulders), I was surprised that the medium sweatshirt is MASSIVE. I should have ordered a small, but I was too enchanted by the softness and beautiful green color to send it back before wearing it. It is even more comfortable than I'd expected, but the sleeves are just too long, and the arm and body areas are huge. I get cold in it unless I wear a long sleeve shirt under it, due to air flow.",Beware: sizing is for (large) men + Updated Review,1.0,B0002NYVOG

No neck tags but kind of a weird sleeve logo. A friend thought I had dipped the sleeve in something at dinner the other night.

"I tried several places to find a shirt that I can wear at work that I wouldn't mind getting beat up a bit.  There were a few places that I tried, but their shirts shrunk.  I wear a 3x and a comfortable shirt is already hard to find, but then I found this shirt on the internet and gave it a try.  I am happy to find how comfortable this shirt is.  Not on the heavy side which makes it easier to move around in, and is quite durable.  Don't particularly care too much for the logo on the end of the sleeve, especially since I roll my sleeves up at time so they won't tear, but that is insignificant.  Anyone who has big arms or big biceps will find the cuffed ends of the sleeve uncomfortable for a little bit until they stretch a little.  Personally, I have a weightlifter/football player body and I like how the shirt wears on me not to tight, or too loose, but shows that I am this big beefy guy.  Also, the shirt breathes rather well, if exercising in it is your concern.  Definitely would return to buy more.",Trying to find a comfort big shirt,4.0,B0002X4HTK

The fabric is not as soft as my J. Crew ($20)layering tee, but it's still comfortable. I really like the width or thickness of the collar on the tee. Some t-shirts have a very narrow & thin collar but the Russell Tee is perfect.

The long sleeve shirt material has gotten progressively thinner to the point where the shirt can't be worn by itself in cool-to-cold weather. OK for layering but not as a stand alone shirt.

"I was awfully disappointed in these shirts (ordered 4 of them).  I had purchased what I thought was the same shirt at a local store (Fred Meyer) at Christmas.  I paid less for the Russell shirt at ""Freddies"" than I did here but figured they would be worth the extra expense.  The shirts I received, and it took a long time for them to arrive, were of much thinner material.

These Amazon-marketed Russell shirts are made in the same pattern as the heavier one I purchased earlier at Fred Meyer; thus, these new shirts fit my husband very well.  He wears XX-large (to cover his large tummy) but has a smaller neck, meaning that most XX-large shirts' necks have huge openings that are way too large for him.  These Russell shirts have smaller neck openings and look very nice on him.  He is happy with them, although finds them rather light weight for this cold winter weather now.  All in all, I am still glad I bought these four shirts for him.

I do warn the larger man to be aware that the neck openings on these shirts are much narrower than in most big men T-shirts.",A bit flimsy but nice looking...,3.0,B0002X4HTK
"I bought this shirt because of the Russell brand of sweat shirts I previously purchased. The Russell sweat shirts are great, this shirt, however, is not well made.

Within two washes, the collar and the cuffs began to lose shape. The fit and construction of the shirt is very poor and the Russell logo on the left sleeve also began to fade.

I have also purchased the Champion long sleeve shirt on Amazon at a lower price and found that it is a superior product to the Russell shirt.

However, my husband got this same shirt 15 years ago and I noticed about a month ago that the collar was very worn and the seams were wearing thin. We both remarked on how awesome it was that the shirt had lasted so long and so well because he loves that shirt and wears it alot. So, as a Father's day surprise I decided to hunt for a similar shirt. I was thrilled to find that the exact same shirt is still being made! So I bit the bullet and bought four of them (two long sleeved and two short sleeved). For me to spend $160 it has to be a darn good shirt. But I figured if that last for 15 years it's worth it.

"Reviewers were not joking when they said this shirt ran large. Way too large. My husband normally wears an XL, but after reading many reviews he decided to order a size down to a large. When it arrived, even the large was ridiculously big. He was swimming in this shirt. A medium would've been perfect for him, but even so, maybe a little loose. He doesn't like his clothes skin tight at all. My husband likes his clothes to be loose and breath well, but this shirt style definitely runs on the big side.

Not only does it run big, the cut of it also is very far from slim cut. It's a very relaxed fit. Too relaxed even for him. Other than the fit, the shirt was good quality and lightweight. It was well made and the design is nice. We loved the flap in the back and the pockets. Everything was good besides the fit. We had to return the shirt because it was just gigantic.",Runs LARGE.,4.0,B0002XSXWW

"If you are used to Levi's or the regular Wrangler jeans, here's some help in choosing a the right fit for this. This jean is the ""slim"" version of classic Cowboy Cut jean that Wrangler has been making since 1947. Among the Levi's jeans, the fit of this jeans is most similar to that of the Levi's 512,but it is cut slimmer in the seat. It doesn't have as much orange stitching as a Levi's, the back pockets sit higher. It has a zipper fly. The so-called ""rigid denim"" looks a lot like the ""shrink to fit"" rigid denim of the Levi's button fly 501 when new and will lose a lot of indigo dye on the first wash, but that's where the resemblance ends. The 501 shrinks about 10%, but the Wrangler shrinks less than 3%, because it is Sanforized. But, since even 3% shrinkage adds up to almost a full inch on a 32 waist, you should probably go up one inch to play safe.

The the really neat thing about the Wrangler is that they still have copper rivets on the back pockets, something Levi's stop doing generations ago when schools complained that the rivets scratched the wood desk chairs the school kids used to sit in!

Compared to the regular the Wrangler Cowboy Cut, the this slim Fit is quite a bit skimpier. The slim fit seat is smaller and the legs are pretty trim--it's more of a boy's cut. If you are really on the thin side, it may work for you, but many men will find it too constricting in the waist and seat.

Wranglers stonewash finishes are pretty mainstream compared to some of the more exotic things Levi's is doing now. These definitely are not so-called ""destructed"" jeans. You won't find whiskering or abrasion the way you will on the stonewash Levi's.

Overall, these are very solid well-made jeans that offer a nice alternative to the more popular Levi's models. Like Levi's, they are well made and indestructible.",Excellent Jeans.,5.0,B0006U695E

"Fit is interesting, personal and use dependent as well as Wrangler's style designations.  In the George StraIt Brand, for a given waist size I've found the Wrangler fit to range from skinniest to most generous cut of the cloth in the seat and thighs to be :
1 (""Slim Fit"") ,
2 ""Regular Fit""
3 ""Original Fit""
4 ""Relaxed Fit""

I have big seat and thighs (a family trait) for my wait and no ""Dunlap Disease"" along the belt line.  I've determined there is almost a half size difference in the seat and thighs between each of the 4 fit designations for a given waist size.  While I'll never get into a ""Slim Fit"" pair of pants unless going up 2 waist sizes I can wear either a size 38 Original Fit or a 36 Relaxed fit and the seat and thigh room seems to be / is the same for me.  I could likely wear a 38 Regular Fit for a cleaner, snugger look as a ""dress"" jean but the pants would ride lower on my hips, below my natural (belly button) waist.

Further, I can get into a 35 waist Relaxed fit for dress purposes, but would not have enough room to ride a horse or motorcycle because the 35's are not loose enough in the crotch for long periods of generally motionless sitting.

The whole fit process is trial and error I did not think would be this complicated, but I am used to a business suit a good tailor can work with.  Jeans are sewn to be worked in, not tailored, so trial and error seem to be a necessary evil of getting a good fit.  Unfortunately , there are not a lot of brick and mortar store that carry EVERY manufacturers FULL line.

Bottom line for me is;  Get a waist line that works for where you want the pants to ride on your hips, and a length to work with your purpose (cowboy boots wearing or horse or motorcycle riding need 1 -2"" longer inseam).  Then if you have a scrawny lower body order Slim and Regular and send one of them back.  Muscular lower body, order Regular and Orginal and send one back.  Soft lower body and genetically ""built for comfort not speed"" (like mine) order Original and Relaxed fit and send one of them back.",George Strait Wrangler Fit Learnings.,5.0,B0007CKM4A

All in all good quality but you have to check leg seams for straightness which seems to be a common problem on all jeans though not as bad as the last Levis I looked at. Wrangler sells a MWZ41 which advertises 20% longer wear. They are just like the MWZ13 but heavier denim. I grabbed two of them and they look good. There pre-washed so shrinking shouldn't be a problem.  I like Amazon's fast and easy shipping but with the flux of todays jean market, I don't think I'll buy anymore without trying on first.

"I have found that these and the ""cowboy cut originals"" are the only ones that have the back pockets up where they need to be!

I don't like to sit on my wallet - on my Harley or at my kitchen table.  I wear dress slacks during the week with pockets in the normal spots...but man, is it ever hard to find jeans anymore that have pockets high enough that you don't sit on your wallet!  (we have medical people in our family  - and it doesn't take a dr. to tell you that it's wrong for your body to sit on your wallet...but man, the things you learn!

anyway - these are OK - The thighs are little on the floppy side...but then again the originals are a little on the tight side....so it's fine.  And they do tighten up after a wash or two, as well as start to fade to a lived in look color.  (I'm not a fan of the ""new jean"" look, I like mine to appear like they have been mine for awhile.

the cuffs - I had to return them...but them I bought them again (thanks Amazon Prime!) I ended up cutting each cuff about 1 1/2"" on the inside seam on each leg.  To get them to fit over my boots.  Then I tacked/sewed the top part of those cuts so they won't open up any further.  They are ok now when you do that.

Until I received these, I'd only seen the discount store variety, and these were normally thinner denim.
These jeans are really jeans, with a 15.25 oz. weight and they have a soft finish, so feel good even brand new.
I'm not a real tall guy, 5.11, but built all leg. Finding a 34W X 36L was easy, and not often times in other brands.
The description is accurate when they say the jeans fit in the seat and give some room in the thigh and knee area, even for a guy like me with thick thighs, they are not glued on.
So, you've got thick soft denim, snug waist and saddle, room to wiggle, and length. I call that really jeans.

"Wrangler makes an excellent pair of somewhat loose fitting, ""relaxed fit"" rugged, durable jeans for men who want a somewhat casual look to their work (or play) jeans. Moreover, these jeans are a good choice for people like me who are slightly overweight. They really do give you extra room in the thigh and the seat; and that's great!

The denim is nice and thick; and these jeans are extremely durable. The excellent stitching helps make this possible. These jeans will last years at a time without any fraying--even at the bottoms of the legs. They are made from 100% cotton and they are permanent press.

I would wash these jeans with similar colors to avoid any color dye bleeding onto white garments in the wash or dryer cycle. They say that you should tumble dry these on low; but I use the permanent press settings on my dryer and that seems to work fine without any problems.

Unfortunately, unlike black jeans, these dark blue jeans are probably not the best choice for an office environment unless jeans are allowed.

Overall, these excellent men's jeans by Wrangler easily rival jeans made by other manufacturers. Make sure you choose the right size; and you may find that the pricing and availability chart above is useful to you. Don't think that the ""20X"" has anything to do with the sizing of these jeans--it's just a marketing gimmick.

"I purchased these shorts for my husband because he liked the same brand and style that I purchased at a store for $65. He washed and dried them and the threads did shrink causing the shorts to look like they need ironed. Washing instructions- ""Do not iron"".

"I was a big fan of the Columbia nylon shorts that had a back pocket, two front pockets, and a cargo pocket on each leg. I can't that style anymore, so I decided to give these a try. I was a little concerned with the 7.5"" inseam, as the Columbia's were closer to 9"", but these are just right for me. I really like the fabric, the elastic waistband, and the fact that there's no mesh liner in them. The thigh pockets are a bit small, but they hold my snuff can, keys, and smaller items just fine. I also like the belt loops. If I weigh the shorts down with gear, a belt will keep them in place. These shorts are pricey, but the quality of material should make them last for many years.",I really like the fabric,5.0,B000BBG624

"I'm always reluctant to order clothing online, but I needed a Hawaiian shirt in a hurry and had no interest in going from store to store in Michigan in January looking for a Hawaiian shirt. I saw this one on Amazon and have always had good experiences ordering from Amazon. I ordered the shirt and hoped it would arrive before the date I needed it. Long story short, the shirt arrived in plenty of time, in a much smallet package than I expected. I opened the package and was very impressed with the shirt. The colors are beautiful, the sewing is great,i.e., matching the pattern where sewing has been done. The only thing I considered to be a drawback was the size of the shirt. I normally wear a XXL and I ordered a XXL. The shirt was more than adequate but a tiny bit more room would have been nice. Nonetheless, I am very pleased with the look, the feel, and yes, even the fit. I would order this shirt again in a minute, but I think this one will fulfill all my needs for a Hawaiian shirt for a long time.",Cool Hawaiian Shirt,4.0,B000BTDXE0

"This is a beautiful Hawaiian theme shirt. I ordered an XX-Large, on the basis of a fair bit more people reporting the sizing being too small vs too large. I normally wear an X-Large. This is definitely bigger than the X-Large shirts I normally wear, but not exceedingly so. It still fits nicely, with just a little bit more girth around the midsection. I don't know that I'd want to go down to the XL, as it might make the shoulders and chest a little tight. The print and colors are beautiful and the fabric is very nice.

"I'm 5'10"" and about 160 pounds and I got the white shirt in my normal size of Medium. After washing, drying and wearing it for a couple of months, it finally dawned on me that it was a bit too big. Now, I don't like tight muscle shirts. I hate them, in fact, since they're too hot in the gym. I prefer them a bit loose. But I started thinking that my Medium was a bit TOO loose, and also too long. I found myself doing partial tucks to try to effectively shorten the shirt. Finally, I decided to try a Small. Understand that normally I would never, ever even think about buying a tee shirt in Small, or really anything other than my normal size Medium. But the Medium was roomy enough, and the shirt inexpensive enough, that I thought I'd try the Small. After washing and drying it -- and it did shrink -- I think it actually fits better than the Medium. It's not tight -- as I say, I hate tight tanks -- but really seems to have a better fit. Shorter, too, without in any way being too short. I might occasionally still wear the medium, which provides more air flow and is more revealing. But I think I'll be preferring the Small, especially since I hate tanks that are too long, hanging down far enough to cover, well, too much, front and rear. The Small fits neater. I never thought I'd recommend a Small to anyone who takes a Medium, but in this case, you might find it worth considering. I've included a photo of each -- Small at left, Medium at right. Judge for yourself.","These run a bit big. I have a Medium (my normal size) and a Small, and I think I'm going to prefer the latter.",4.0,B000GIOET4

"I just got my stringer today. I'm normally a medium but ordered a small (since the other posted reviews recommended getting a size smaller) and they were right. The shirt is 100% cotton so the quality is meh. For a stringer, the sizing seems a little awkward near the top/armpit. It might just be a tad too loose near the top, but maybe it'll shrink when I dry it which might fix that issue. Other than that, solid shirt, i'd say i like it but don't love it.

"I really like the sweatpants a lot. They come as advertised as far as sizing/fitting. This particular pair, however, came (for me anyway) in SIGNIFICANTLY darker colors than the photo. There is much more of the deep & dark navy blue, and MUCH less light blue and white. It's unfortunate because I ordered this pair specifically for a 90's throwback party and the what I received does not match the rest of my outfit like I had expected. Nonetheless, the pants are sweet and I would definitely order another pair. The comfort, quality, look, and big pockets are huge selling points. Also, for those with the same SIZING QUESTIONS as me, I am 6'0 190lbs and usually wear a 36"" waist and 30-32"" length in jeans. My sizes are all on the border of Large vs. XL so I went with the XL to be safe. My next pair will absolutely be Large. The XL are a good amount longer in the leg than I want/need.

Love these pants. They feel so delicious against my thighs because they rub against them really delicately. Like a soothing baby sea lion. I saw a sea lion once in Maine. He came onto my boat and we gave each other back rubs. He rubbed his paw fin all over my face and I laughed so hard. It was so awesome and funny. I wish I had a selfie stick at that time.

"I recently purchased these compression shorts for my boyfriend. He usually buys the cheeper brands, but I wanted to test the theory and see if a more expensive pair would really be worth the money. The instant he put these on, his standards for compression shorts changed completely! He absolutely loves these! He couldn't explain in words how much more comfortable, and supportive these shorts are. He then asked how much they cost, I simply replied ""about $20-$30 less on amazon, then they would have if I had bought them at an athletics store"".",He is pleased..,5.0,B000MVUCCI
"These compression shorts are very comfortable to wear especially wen you are constantly moving around during a game or during practice and because they are the 7"" model they suited a ""Big & Tall"" person like me who used to have issues with compression shorts riding up during physical activity. The large waist band also ensured that the shorts stayed in place while also being very comfortable around the waist.

My only advice would be to pick a slightly darker colour (at time of purchase only white was available in the size I was after) if you are going to be rolling around in dirt ie. playing Rugby.

"While these stayed together, they were very good (I'd have given them 4 stars). Maybe I'm expecting too much, but these only lasted about 6-8 months before the seams along the inner thigh pulled apart. I bought five pairs of these and only walked about 5 miles per week in each pair (one pair per day), washed them on the delicate cycle in our front-loading washer, and always hung them to dry. All five pairs failed within a 3-week period.

"Originally purchased in July 2011. For over a year I thought this a 5-star suit. Then about six months ago the elastic started to go. Now the elastic is totally shot and the lining has pulled loose to the extent that it has lost it's function. Originally medium, the suit looks and feels like large now. I swim laps 3-5 times a week and rinse the suit thoroughly each time. No problem with fading, and the outer fabric seems to be wearing like iron. If you're not going to get more than 18 months out of a suit, save some $$$ with another brand. I'm replacing with a TYR suit for about $9 less.
12/2/14 Update. The elastic in the TYR suit that I got at the end of May 2013 gave out a few months sooner than the Speedo's, but I've just ordered another because I like the feel in the water. It's called a drag suit but you're barely aware of it when you swim. The Speedo feels like just too much material for lap swimming. I kept using the TYR by tightening the cord, but could never quite get it tight enough and eventually tore out the cord (this is #1 reason that I'm replacing it now). BTW the suit is totally faded. Was navy, is now silvery and sheer looking. Flesh shows thru the legs, but the liner is still good, so the privates are private enough. At this time the price difference is about $6 in favor of TYR.",Expected it to last langer,3.0,B000YT1VZ0
"I recently started swimming again, and this appears to be the only short pair of trunks on the market for workout/athletic swimming. I have, at present, a good 36 to 37 inch waist, and I just fit into the large size (so the size chart is pretty spot on). I like the freedom afforded by the short 14.5 (or so) outseam and 3.5-4 inch inseam. They're long enough to be modest but short enough to minimize the bulk. I wouldn't want them to be any longer.

Like my previous Speedo trunks, the fabric dries quickly, and the suit feels well-made. The only thing that would make it better is at least one pocket, should I have to use these at a hotel pool or other location without a locker room for storing a key or cash.

Update:  Now the Rally V Volley is the Speedo Trunk with two front pockets and a zipped back pocket.  The Roofer has been discontinued.  I think the Volley is 1"" longer than the Roofer (19"" vs. 18"", sigh.)  Why do folks think that shorts should hang down to the knees?

"Originally purchased in July 2011. For over a year I thought this a 5-star suit. Then about six months ago the elastic started to go. Now the elastic is totally shot and the lining has pulled loose to the extent that it has lost it's function. Originally medium, the suit looks and feels like large now. I swim laps 3-5 times a week and rinse the suit thoroughly each time. No problem with fading, and the outer fabric seems to be wearing like iron. If you're not going to get more than 18 months out of a suit, save some $$$ with another brand. I'm replacing with a TYR suit for about $9 less.
12/2/14 Update. The elastic in the TYR suit that I got at the end of May 2013 gave out a few months sooner than the Speedo's, but I've just ordered another because I like the feel in the water. It's called a drag suit but you're barely aware of it when you swim. The Speedo feels like just too much material for lap swimming. I kept using the TYR by tightening the cord, but could never quite get it tight enough and eventually tore out the cord (this is #1 reason that I'm replacing it now). BTW the suit is totally faded. Was navy, is now silvery and sheer looking. Flesh shows thru the legs, but the liner is still good, so the privates are private enough. At this time the price difference is about $6 in favor of TYR.",Expected it to last langer,3.0,B000YT1VZ0
"I recently started swimming again, and this appears to be the only short pair of trunks on the market for workout/athletic swimming. I have, at present, a good 36 to 37 inch waist, and I just fit into the large size (so the size chart is pretty spot on). I like the freedom afforded by the short 14.5 (or so) outseam and 3.5-4 inch inseam. They're long enough to be modest but short enough to minimize the bulk. I wouldn't want them to be any longer.

Like my previous Speedo trunks, the fabric dries quickly, and the suit feels well-made. The only thing that would make it better is at least one pocket, should I have to use these at a hotel pool or other location without a locker room for storing a key or cash. I prefer board shorts at water parks.

"John, what you want is the Speedo Roofer, Style number 7320167.  It has two normal front pants-type pockets and a  right rear hidden zip pocket, perfect for a drivers license, credit card and perhaps a bit of cash wrapped around it.

Otherwise the style is nearly identical to this one.  The store that sounds like a 1 cent coin used to stock it every year, but this year they're carrying something a little longer.

Update:  Now the Rally V Volley is the Speedo Trunk with two front pockets and a zipped back pocket.  The Roofer has been discontinued.  I think the Volley is 1"" longer than the Roofer (19"" vs. 18"", sigh.)  Why do folks think that shorts should hang down to the knees?

Dec. 10, 2012 Update:  The Rally or Rally Volley, both style number 7840110 is now the model with two front pockets and a zipped rear pocket.  The inseam is still 19"" instead of the Roofer's 18"".

I normally wear a medium (31 waste), but these are a large.  I am 6 ft. and they barely touch the bottom of my foot without shoes on.  It is easy to roll, but that makes them tighter.

"If you are used to Levi's or the regular Wrangler jeans, here's some help in choosing a the right fit for this. This jean is the ""slim"" version of classic Cowboy Cut jean that Wrangler has been making since 1947. Among the Levi's jeans, the fit of this jeans is most similar to that of the Levi's 512,but it is cut slimmer in the seat. It doesn't have as much orange stitching as a Levi's, the back pockets sit higher. It has a zipper fly. The so-called ""rigid denim"" looks a lot like the ""shrink to fit"" rigid denim of the Levi's button fly 501 when new and will lose a lot of indigo dye on the first wash, but that's where the resemblance ends. The 501 shrinks about 10%, but the Wrangler shrinks less than 3%, because it is Sanforized. But, since even 3% shrinkage adds up to almost a full inch on a 32 waist, you should probably go up one inch to play safe.

The the really neat thing about the Wrangler is that they still have copper rivets on the back pockets, something Levi's stop doing generations ago when schools complained that the rivets scratched the wood desk chairs the school kids used to sit in!

Compared to the regular the Wrangler Cowboy Cut, the this slim Fit is quite a bit skimpier. The slim fit seat is smaller and the legs are pretty trim--it's more of a boy's cut. If you are really on the thin side, it may work for you, but many men will find it too constricting in the waist and seat.

Wranglers stonewash finishes are pretty mainstream compared to some of the more exotic things Levi's is doing now. These definitely are not so-called ""destructed"" jeans. You won't find whiskering or abrasion the way you will on the stonewash Levi's.

Overall, these are very solid well-made jeans that offer a nice alternative to the more popular Levi's models. Like Levi's, they are well made and indestructible.",Excellent Jeans.,5.0,B0006U68V4

My oldest pair in rotation (still in one piece) is three years old and the zipper busted right at the dang seam. I tried to fix it myself but now it looks like my fly is open when it isn't, so I gotta fix it better. Bought another pair last week, first day I wore em to work and the zipper busted right open. Hadn't even done anything that rough in em yet, just got breezy on me. Made the rest of the shift a little cooler though, with our good Florida heat we got. Now I got two pair that need fixing in the same spot. Bought another pair to replace the week old pair and I accidentally bought the rigid wash, rigid sucks. Don't buy rigids unless you got a body double four sizes smaller to break em in cause they are so ridiculously tight and unforgiving.

"One day while contemplating my favorite well-fitting bra (and the expensive price tag that is TOTALLY worth it!) I wondered what my husband would think if I spent as much research, care and investment when buying briefs for him.  But how would I find out what kind of underwear men liked?  I wanted something supportive . . . so I started looking on a website for prostate cancer sufferers, thinking these men have been poked and prodded and need ""support.""  Right away, I started reading about these briefs.  The ""Body Brief"" came up again and again, with these patients all mentioning that the ""pouch"" feature in the front was the ""cushioned comfort"" they had been missing all their lives.  At $18 each, I was a little sticker-shocked, but I certainly pay more than that for a good bra . . . my husband was now 48 and I didn't want him to miss out on his comfort for a minute longer!

I bought two pairs and wrapped them up for Christmas.  I couldn't wait for him to wear them.  He put them on (I helpfully instructed him that he should ""lift and place"" in the pouch, because that's what the comments on various sites had suggested for the most supportive fit).  I'm sure he felt self-conscious while I watched him parade around, wearing a goofy grin on my face, bursting with anticipation -- I fully expected him to feel the same way about these undies that I had when I first tried on my most supportive bra.

Well, he was a little underwhelmed, so I decided not to push.  Three days later he confided in me that he had worn the 2 new pairs, and had then returned to wearing his ordinary Hanes briefs, and only then did he realize the difference, and he LOVED the new Body Briefs!

I have since bought him 2 pairs whenever I want to do something nice for him, and we have slowly replaced all his old briefs with these Calvin Klein Body Briefs.  And I will add -- WOW -- he looks FABULOUS in these briefs!  They definitely enhance his assets nicely.","What Victoria Secret does for bras, these briefs do for my husband",5.0,B002RWKK22

"I must confess that buying CK underwear lately has become sort of an expedition to the Lost World. Their selection used to be pretty simple to chose from and fairly straightforward, but now they have way too many configurations, fits, materials, colors, etc; it can become a frustrating experience to decide which one you should buy, particularly because CK keeps changing its product line and models that were available as close as a year ago are not available anymore, and there is no way to know which new models are replacing them. I can understand that consumers need choice and count me in, but the exercise of picking up CK underwear shouldnt be as difficult as picking which College to attend

OK, so after getting the above out of my system, now to the product: Super comfortable, superior fitting, great look and nice construction, no one can match CK quality and style and they made their statement once again with these briefs. They stay true to form for the whole day, which can be a problem with cotton if it is not of the best quality, it tends to get loose and after a few hours you fill like ""the guys"" want to dance free. But not with these CKs, they can last a whole 8 hours or so like they were just used for the first time. The only complain I have is that after a few washes the waistband have shrunk a bit and they can be a bit tight until it stretches out, but I expected this, it is common on all 100% cotton underwear. They also a bit on the expensive side but, if you get them on sale (as me) their value proposition is unmatchable by any competitor",Amazingly Comfortable,5.0,B002RWKK22

But the back is just not there. Instead of straps which attach at odd angles, the back is a surround of wider, more comfortable waist and straps which fit the contours of the male body. The leg straps don't roll or twist. They actually feel good while leaving the back open for ventilation (and a very sexy look). This is great for sport, the gym or everyday wear.

I've owned SafeTGards before  but all of mine have been made in USA.  My experience with the older ones is they don't last like other brands such as Bike, McDavid, and Mueller, but the trade off was that SafeTGards came in colors other than black or white.

So I get this new one in a size large.  If my man parts weighed about 4 1/2 pounds perhaps the pouch might offer some support, but such is not the case.  I see other reviewers that had a similar experience to mine as well as some that find the fit to be fine.  Perhaps the luck of the draw; I don't know.  Since I have this in the made in USA version (yes in red; it was wearing out) also in a size large, I can tell you that the waist is bigger on the non USA version as is the pouch; I laid them side by side and on top of each other and compared them.

If you are gonna wear this for fashion not function it would probably be fine; otherwise, order about two sizes smaller than normal and whatever you do, wash the thing in one of those mesh bags (they have them at the dollar store) to squeeze out as much life and prevent stretching and unraveling.",Really disappointed.,1.0,B003WRVH8C

"I loved my robe when I first got it.  I was concerned that it would be too small being an L/XL as I usually take an XL or XXL in this type of bathrobe.  I like it big like a robe should be. I also wanted something thinner to pack for business trips. I loved it right out of the bag. BUT I decided to wash it before I took it on my first business trip so it would possibly soften up and smell fresh.  Bad idea!  I washed it in COLD water and dried it on a GENTLE cycle even.  It shrank, boy did it shrink!
When I took it out of the dryer, I noticed it seemed shorter and to my GREAT dismay it was not only shorter, it was smaller all the way around ... Including the sleeves once loose and comfortable (not too big, just right) were now VERY tight. And before I washed it I could wrap it comfortably around my body with room to be comfortable. Was now barely able to wrap it to cover my body! What a huge disappointment! If only I had not washed it or dried it. It would've been a great robe to even wear at home and not just take on business trips where I didn't want something bulky to pack.  So I re-wet it and tried to stretch it out before just hang drying it.  Which helped a very tiny bit, enough so I could take it on the trip I had intended but was horribly dis-satisfied that it had shrank so much even though I had cautiously washed it in cold water and tumble dried it on low heat as the label directed. I guess ""Egyptian Cotton"" means 'definitely shrinkable cotton' ... I would return it if I could.

I guess he just got use to them.",I LOVED the way these looked on my husband,5.0,B00E2RRT9M

"Size chart is just wrong. Im a 34 waist, average hang, ordered xl and still spend all my time adjusting my ""anatomy"", in spite of the pouch.

"A grey set of these in XL showed up on my doorstep. I promptly washed them and began wearing them, one at a time of course.

"These are extremely tight and have a really weird pouch for your ""junk"".  They are uncomfortable and feel really weird. They make every stick straight out and that not only feels weird it causes your pants to constantly be pressing on you.","No good for you ""junk""",1.0,B00E2RRT9M
"First of all, the size. These are obviously made for ""Asian sizing"". I wear a 30-31, ordered a medium and they fit perfectly without being baggy or too loose. The pouch in the front is not actual pouch like you'll get in some support/enhancing underwear... it's simply the cut of the design that leaves more than enough room and tightens a little right behind where your twins will sit - it provides some great support and a little lift.

The cut is absolutely perfect for what I like in Trunk Briefs: It's short on the leg, contoured around the crotch area, and sits in the middle on my hips; it's not like those dumb ""Low-Cut"" or ""No-show"" underwear that is EVERYWHERE on Amazon these days. If you wear your jeans a little on the low side (not sagging) you'll get a bit of the waistband popping up, which is also cool.

I can see why some guys say these highlight your junk, but honestly they just provide good support without being too tight and they fit really well on me (I'm an athletic build). I've had trunks that say ""great support"" and they end up squeezing everything together - these don't; they give you support without any pressure on anything.

A plus for me was that the packaging is also simple - there's no borderline-obscene photos on anything.

About the way they last, I just bought these last week so I'll update my review later on if the overall quality is low.",Runs Small But Super Comfortable & Supportive,5.0,B00E2RRT9M

"Six Stars!! These are my husband's favorite-ever garment. These shorts fit well and look nice; they're spectacularly well-constructed and stand up to a beating. Bought this pair to replace his roughly 10-year-old Survivalists which he wears nearly every day during hot weather: he wears 'em for yard work, goes hiking & fishing, washes 'em frequently and they've lasted like good quality clothes are supposed to! They're equally good for hard work or for lazing around the house or going out for a casual meal. The only reason he finally needed a new pair is that after 9 or 10 seasons of hard use the fabric wore through in one place (one spot on the leg under the cargo pocket that wrinkles because of his body size & how he sits). These shorts are MADE TO LAST!

The fabric is heavy-duty, coated cotton that feels really soft from day one: this fabric has a wonderful 'hand' - ""it feels great to wear"" (direct quote from The Husband). Along with the quality elastic in the waist there is a sturdy-but-soft heavy-duty cotton drawstring, a feature my husband loves. Multiple pockets make these handsome shorts very good for things like fly fishing or any endeavor where you need to stash a few things for easy access, and the pockets are sturdy too with reinforced stitching in all the necessary places.

If you need a pair of shorts that will be comfortable, perform well, look good and put up with abuse these are the shorts for you. I sure wish they made 'em for women!",Soft & comfy & wear like iron: the perfect guy shorts!,5.0,9789892837

"I had to respond to most of the other reviewers of 2(x)ist jeans, because I love them and think the sale price is the steal of the century.

These are LINEN JEANS.  They are thinner than Levi 501's or regular thick jeans.  They're meant to be, and are great for warm weather or any time you're not mining gold.  These also have a low rise, like the name ""So Low Jeans"" would suggest, even though the rise isn't as low as some other jeans.

The waist size seems fine to me.  Based on previous reviews, I bought a size up but that was bad advice.  If anything, I'd recommend rounding down if you're borderline between sizes.  I normally wear between 29 and 30 waist and I bought 31 based on the recommendations; the 29 fits me perfectly.  I know stores like Wal-Mart or Target often cut their clothes VERY large, so if you're used to those sizes then adjust accordingly.

I think these jeans are great and have no major complaints.  The wash is inconsistent though; I bought two pairs of ""Banger"" jeans to make up for the waist sizing error and the washes looked almost completely different.  They both look good, though.  I'm guessing they are test marketing these jeans on Amazon (because I can't find any info on them anywhere else, including 2xist's own web site) so they might be tinkering with the formula a little bit.

Highly recommended to the slim and hip (or wannabe hip like me)",Incredible jeans.,5.0,B0006LBXUE
"I normally wear 32x32 jeans, so I was pleased when my 32x32 Dubliners fit perfectly. The styling was not as dramatic as in the pictures, and this also pleased me. My only complaint regarding the fit or looks is that the flare is a bit large. It's not too bad, though.

However, I have a major complaint with the durability of these jeans. The fabric is exceptionally thin; any time there is any stress on the seams, the stitches look like they're going to pop out. Plus, I wore them only once and there's already a hole in the fabric. Needless to say, I am not pleased.

Pros: Fit as expected, look cool, low price.

Cons: Exceptionally thin fabric, low durability.

Conclusion: These jeans aren't worth it, even for $20.",Not recommended -- low durability,2.0,B0006LBXUE
"I'd like make one point before reviewing these ""jeans"". They are LOW RISE jeans, meant to be worn on the HIPS. When you order, order your HIP SIZE, not your waist, otherwise you may be dissapointed to find that they do not fit you, or are one size too tight.

Okay, I ordered this with high expectations, considering it's from one of the leading designers for male underwear, but these jeans are a letdown compared to other products manufactured my 2(x)ist. Just as a poin of reference, I purchased this pair and the Banger style, from the same brand, same size. That last point is very important as the Dubliner seems to be an inch more loose and with an extra inch on the inseam, which is quite annoying. The Banger pair fits like a charm. There are quite a few cons I'd like to point out though.

One, the fabric is rather thin, and I was surprised to find the tag noting that it is 100% cotton. They feel (and smell, even) more like polyester, as hard as that is to believe. Two... They are rather soft for jeans, but they just don't have the feel or texture you would expect from denim. I'm not exactly satisfied with these jeans, not considering the difference in fit compared to the Banger pair. The wash itself looks alright, but the front has very many light specks which LOOK like pulled threads, which is a bad thing, although they just seem to be part of the style. As I wrote in my other review, I would call these faux jeans as opposed to authentic denim. The actual stitch seems rahter cheap as well. Aside from that, I would say 19.99 is a just price for the product, but it is definitely not worth the 128 retail. Why they even put that on the tag to begin with is beyond me. Concerning the durability... they DO seem built to last, though I have to admit, they can't possibly be as durable as higher grade denims.",You call these jeans??,2.0,B0006LBXUE
"I was a little skeptical of ordering jeans online, and them fitting correctly, but was pleasantly surprised with these (and also purchased the Hero design).

First off, the jeans are not very heavy.  There were 2 pairs of jeans in the box and it really felt like there was only one pair.

Normally I wear a waist in the 32-34 range, and the 33's fit like I had expected.  I would say to perhaps order one size up if possible.

I really like the design of the Dubliner's with a lighter blue at the top, going to a dark blue at the bottom.

The reason I'm giving this a 4 out of 5 is that I wish they would have had a 34 waist at the time I ordered, because I think it would have been a bit more comfortable, but I am still very pleased with the 33 waist.",Good jeans for the price,4.0,B0006LBXUE

"After reading the other reviews, I couldn't help wondering whether the reviewers were either being too particular, or were avoiding their own weight issues.  I've worn Hanes briefs, along with other brands, on and off for many years.  Could there really be much difference between the ""new"" Hanes briefs and the ""old"" ones?

The answer:  Yes.  I bought a 3-pack (34's), and lo and behold, unlike any other briefs I've ever owned, the grey waistband is made so that it only stretches so far.  As another reviewer said, it was like there's a tied drawstring inside.  To be sure, I had little trouble fitting into my size--anyone who says ""I struggled and struggled and I'm positive I've got a 32 waist but these 32s wouldn't go on"" needs to get a grip, stop the denial, and shed a few pounds or buy some 34s.  BUT, these briefs ARE slightly smaller than all the other 34s I own, and I've got a drawer full, from three other manufacturers.  And the fabric is thinner than previous Hanes, and thinner than most other briefs.  So the bottom line is they aren't unwearable, just chintzy.  Hanes has obviously decided to cut costs at the consumer's expense.  Too bad, but that's what you get for the price, at least from Hanes.

UPDATE:

After two years of use, the waistbands on the Hanes are overstretched and falling apart, and strings from the seams are hanging off.  The briefs I purchased at around the same time from two other manufacturers are in much better shape.  The Hanes are an inferior product, and I won't buy them again",Cheaply Made Budget Briefs.,2.0,B000LRC24O

"My wife usually buys designer brand underwear for me but I though hey, tightie whities are well ... tightie whities.  So when I needed a filler item for free shipping, I thought why not.

When these arrived and I tried them on for the first time, I immediately regretted my decision.  I have a 33 waist yet when I put these 34 waist on, I had a hard time getting into them.  The problem was all about the waistband.  Instead of having a flexible waistband that stretches easily, it felt like there was a tied drawstring inside the waistband.  Once I put them on, it was ok but I felt like I had to pay attention to not break the waistband when sliding my legs into the underwear.  That's weak.
Never buying these again and I don't recommend it to anyone else.

Update: My gripe just continues.  It is even difficult to do number #1 in these because of the waist band.  Because the waist band has no elasticity, it's even hard to pull it down below your junk if you have to p.  Oh, I suppose you can try the thru method.  Bad. Bad.

"Hanes makes an excellent white traditional brief for the gentlemen amongst us who just don't want to wear boxers. The relatively snug fit ensures that these briefs will not ""bunch up"" like loose fitting boxers so often do; and many men prefer these briefs for that reason alone.

The briefs are easy to care for; they are essentially permanent press so any washer and dryer set will clean them well. They seem to last forever, too, which makes them an excellent value.

If you can, try to get these without a tag in the rear so that you won't get an itch caused by the tag. However, even with a tag you usually don't feel any discomfort. I've worn 'em that way for years without a problem. The 100% cotton fibers of these briefs add to the comfort you'll feel, too.

My only real caution--and the main reason that this product gets four stars instead of five--is that these briefs can be tight the first several times you wear them. This may be true for some of us men even if Hanes does claim that these briefs are preshrunk before they hit the store's shelves. I personally would suggest washing them once or twice just to loosen the fit up ever so slightly. Another relatively minor concern is that the elasticity of the waistband eventually does wear out. At that point you do need to buy new briefs--but, then again, nothing lasts forever, right?

Overall, gentlemen who want a close fitting brief that still gives them comfort will be very satisfied with these white men's briefs. The three pack gives you value and they last a long time.",The best briefs in town !!!,4.0,B000LRC24O

Most others wear button shirts when fishing - not my thing.

A moisture wicking base layer is crucial when cross country skiing.  It's the only way to keep dry during an off-times strenuous run.  You cannot wear a lot of clothing when skiing so it is important to keep the moisture off the skin.

This same material is much more expensive when purchasing with a brand name logo (Under Armour, Nike etc.).

It seems to be well made and a good size.  I'm 6' tall and close to 200 lbs and it's a good length for me.  I actually had to turn up the sleeves.

"I was hoping the elastic wasn't too tight and the pants relied more on drawstring, but the band is a little too tight on the medium, while the pant legs are the right fit (I like my waist to feel comfortable while sitting and after eating).

Overall if you are looking for a rash guard/swim shirt to help keep the sun off of you and with a more forgiving fit this is a good way to go.  Only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is that I consider it a pretty expensive shirt for what it is used for.

I really like the stitching and I prefer snaps over buttons.  I highly recommend these well made and fashionable western shirts.,Wrangler 20X - A great product line!,5.0,B00IALP8YO

"Bought for a man who is 5'6"" and generally wears a size medium in all other shirts.  The fit is as expected and the quality is nice.  Sleeve length is long enough and there is room in the chest and shoulders to move unhindered.  I typically have all our western shirts dry cleaned, but have occasionally had to throw these in the wash and these shirts wash up well.  I will continue to buy the Wrangler brand.",Good quality and fit,5.0,B00JY7JZ8S

"I get many compliments on this shirt. The light gray on charcoal paisley pattern, diamond shaped snaps, western yoke and hidden collar buttons make a good look and pleasing appearance.

Should have bought 2 this is such a nice shirt and great colors. My husband is a cowboy.and rides his horse in all seasons. This Shirt is wind resistant and heavier material so he stays warm. 1,Wrangler never disappoints,5.0,B00LVS33TK
"I've always loved the material and durability of this particular Wrangler Brushpopper shirt, and I've been wearing them since I was twelve or thirteen years old. That said, the sleeves are always comically short... it's kind of ridiculous :)

Though I just received it, the shirt feels like the traditional quality you'd expect if you're familiar with this product. My only complaint is the length of the sleeves. I'm not sure if this is a result of Wrangler pinching pennies or just a flaw in their design... I like them so much I wear them anyway! But I do wish they'd address this.

As well, these shirts appear to be in demand. It seems like there is always very limited stock available and what is available disappears quickly. Who is missing this at Wrangler?! Make more!!",Quality material... but use more of it to make longer sleeves please!,3.0,B00LVS33TK
