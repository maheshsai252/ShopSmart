"Lord, could Converse have got it any more right? One thinks not. The Converse All Star Chuck Taylor canvas shoes are everything one could need from a shoe and more. They are stylish, available in colours that vary from orange to pink, the more comtemporary leather versions, low cut and high cut. These baby's contour the foot so well,it's almost like walking on air! The canvas hugs the ankles, providing support...but the most important features of the shoes are that they are unisex (they look great on guys and girls) and they can be dressed down with jeans, or elegantly dressed up with a pair of tailored pants. These shoes are definitely to die for.",The New Roman Sandal That Should Be Owned By Every God...,5.0,B00006XXGO

"When basketballer Charles ""Chuck"" Taylor walked into the Converse company back in 1921 complaining of sore feet, he started a revolution. He designed a shoe that was to bear his name only two years later. It would go on to be THE most popular sneaker of all time. Over 500 million pairs have been sold worldwide. The popularity of these legendary shoes has gone in waves but people have always come back to Chucks throughout the past 80 years! And some people, like myself, just can't get enough of them, and go on to build a collection of these wonderful sneakers. Nowadays I only wear Chucks, no other sneaker graces my feet. They are so comfortable and good looking, and take it from me, they boost your self-esteem! Walk down the street in them and you feel ten feet tall. Sounds corny, but it's true. They're like a security blanket around your ankles. I absolutely love Chucks and won't ever stop wearing them. Do yourself a favour, buy a pair. Then see how long till you get another and another.",The best sneakers on earth. Period.,5.0,B00006XXGO
"I was introduced to Converse All-Star's (Chuck's) two years ago and they are the best shoes I have ever owned.  Before I knew about Chuck's, I would have multiple pairs of sneakers for different activities, now I have one! They have excellent foot support all the way up the ankle, the only downside is that the soles have no arch and if you are not already flat footed, they will probably make you that way.  They are great shoes!",Chuck Taylor's Forever!,5.0,B00006XXGO

"After being associated with the 50's hipster and the 70's hippie, the 80's punk and now the millennium prepster these shoes have made the journey across time and generation. Made with a canvas material and a rubber soul these shoes stand the test of time and once thier broken in will quickly become your favorite pair of shoes . No matter the winter or the summer you'll find yourself pulling these out of the closet to pair with your jeans or your skirt. And owning one pair is never enough. A pair in every color low and high is definitly required for the true converse wearer.

"I love the classic look of Chuck Taylors, but wow, these are legitimately the most uncomfortable shoes I've ever worn. I wore them recently to my work where I'm on my feet for 10 hours and am moving around a lot and lifting stuff, climbing up and down ladders, and by the end of the night I was limping and my feet were throbbing. I have another pair of Chuck Taylors, mid tops, and those have some padding in the sole and I can wear them all night and feel fine.

"Converse will tell you that the shoe runs about a 1/2 size larger than what you normally wear and that is true with these sneakers. Disappointed though that these aren't the original ""vintage"" Chucks that I wore in the late 60s and early 70's...for the original Chucks, you have to go to Nike/Converse's website and they'll run you $80 retail. Limited colors but you can definitely tell the difference in material and craftsmanship when you compare this model of the Converse All Star to the 70's Vintage Chucks.

"I have never bought chucks from on Amazon before and it's difficult to find an 8.5 in them anywhere as it is. So I was thrilled to find these. However, THESE ARE NOT AN 8.5. They are most definitely a 9. And honestly, I don't even believe they are truly Converse. I believe they are KNOCKOFFS. I have had TONS of pairs of Converse. They all have tags sewn onto the inside of the tongue of each shoe and they are fabric tags. The tags on these are some sort of rubber. Never ever had rubber tags before, and I've been buying Converse since high school and I'm now 34. I would have just bought a size 8.

"My feet would ideally fit into the length of a 7 1/2. However, I have wide feet, so I opted for the 8's. The shoe is a little under an inch longer than where my feet end, but it leaves plenty of wiggle room for my toes and makes it comfortable enough to wear thick socks. Just to let you know, the shoe being sold is a little different than the ones in the image shown. The color has more of a yellow-y cream tint instead of a tan and bears a red instead of brown stripe. I suggest googling the color of the shoes (e.g., ""Unbleached White converse"") before buying so you know exactly what the shoes look like for reference as the image may not always accurately align with the product.

Anyone who would claim these boots can't handle whatever you want to throw at them probably doesn't care for their boots properly.

"Having wide feet and wanting high quality leather boots, preferably not in a neon colour, this is the way to go.

Over the last 15 or so years I have worn nothing but Puma King Top shoes. The lightweight high quality kangaroo leather is (in my opinion) a lot better than the lightweight plastic shoes that you see everywhere.
I like the fit, as I have wide feet, and these nicely stretch like thin leather boots should. I normally buy them half a size small, so within a couple of games they fit like a sock.

No problems with blisters, and the sole is just sturdy enough to prevent bone bruising in the ball of the foot even when playing on rock solid soil in the south.
These boots typically last me a calendar year or more, and seeing that I play on them at least 4 times a week, sometimes for 5 hours at a time, it is very impressive.

The only negative that I've encountered is that the stitching of the very tip of the boot tends to get damaged, and therefore can lead to the sole letting go. This normally is the last bit of life I am squeezing out of an old pair, and that is honestly the only problem I have encountered. Seeing as a lot of my team mates end up having to tape the front of their boots together, it seems to be a problem that happens with high end leather as well as the newer synthetic boots they sell a lot.

These are very good quality, very durable, and very comfortable. Also these shoes are easy to slip on and off. In almost every respect, I give these shoes five stars. The only reason I gave it four stars is because it is rather slippery on some surfaces. On most surfaces, like dirt, pavement, tile floors, and cement, the traction is great. The only issue is when walking on polished stone floors or other stone surfaces. Only then do you have to be extra careful. So, if you are outdoors the traction is great.

"Merell's dropped their long-time Ortho-Lite Comfort Insole; and has now lost me as a customer. I was a long-time Merell Men's Jungle Moc customer (of the original style and original tread pattern style). Bought at least a half-dozen of these over 15 years (and they lasted a long time, only would replace when I wore the tread pattern down).

It had been about 3 or 4 years since I bought my last batch and so I ordered a set of new Jungle Moc's in 2018. Incredibly disappointed to realize that they have changed the insole. The new style insole, which they call ""Kinetic,"" is much less comfortable and throws off the balance of these shoes. It is obvious immediately but actually painful if you wear them for more than 10 or 15 minutes.

Product engineers probably trying to justify their job decided to ""improve"" something that never needed improving. So disappointing that Merrell felt like it had to mess with a classic and the shoe that essentially made Merrell. They have lost me as a customer.

"I love these shoes. I've literally been wearing this same model and color for the past six years. I'm on my fourth pair in that amount of time and I wear them every single day of the year, rain or shine.

If you want to have them last longer be sure to waterproof them every month or so in order to keep them dry. After awhile they start to soak up water which will make the rubber around the toe begin to separate. That happened with the first pair that I had and then I started treating them with the spray to avoid this failure.

The only other problem I've experienced is with the heel cup breaking. That's more an artifact of me being really rough with putting my shoes on and probably stepping on the backs too often.",Great shoes. I'm on my fourth pair in six years. Worn every day.,5.0,B00009ZM7Z
"These are my third pair of Merrell Mocs. They are the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn, and last a long, long time. They are easy to slip on, and unlike other slip-on shoes , the heel does not collapse over time. And because the manufacturer makes a size fourteen, they are easy to find. The shoe provides the support and comfort needed to walk on concrete and other hard surfaces. They look good and are ideal for business casual dress. I actually use them to do my one-mile daily walk. They are that comfortable. Well worth the money because they last and last.","Great, Comfortable and Good-Looking Footwear",5.0,B00009ZM7Z

"The overall boot quality is good with leather less dry than than Post's.  However, the right boot is larger than the left and both boots have significant heel slop.  Trying to buy replacement boots has been a learning lesson.  I began this search because Twist X Boot while fitting incredible well in both the ankle and heel and made out of superior leather are not available in 3E width.  Stretching the Twisted boots for width drastically shortens the leathers' life.  Post & Justin boots are made in Mexico and Twisted X in China.  I'm guessing that the latter will not entertain odd sizes due to potential translation/return issues.

"First off I'll say these are really comfortable, quality boots. I ordered the ""aged bark"" color, which in the advertised photo appears darker in color. What arrived was much lighter (see photo).  My Dad has used these boots for years. With every day hard use on our farm you can get about 7 + years (they'll be wore out for sure).

I decided to treat them in Mink Oil to help break them in and aid in water proofing them. This will make them last longer for my use. The picture has:
- Advertised color
- True color
- Side by side color difference with and without  Mink Oil treatment
- Final Mink Oil look (let them bake in the sunshine all day so that the oil soaks in deep)
- Look of a worn pair and the new pair

Being Justin's, they fit like a glove & are very comfortable.

"Bought these based on some reviews that claimed this shoe to be a close replacement for the NB804/6, not even close as far as my fit is concerned.  Yes I am one of those also disappointed with what the other company did with my favorite shoe and am looking for a replacement.
1st off, K-Swiss does not seem to make different widths so if you have very wide feet, you are out of luck. Major differences are the Ultrascendor has a much higher arch and only offers a normal width (narrower) toe area, the heel height is higher from the ground and there is less ankle clearance - meaning the foot sits deeper in the shoe or the sides come up further towards the ankle.  So overall, this is quite a different fitting and feeling shoe from the NB804/6 series, and I would not call this an equivalent alternate.  However, by no means is it bad shoe, it is just quite different.
Now the good part: it is a stiffer shoe that does provide additional stability over the NB804/6 series even though it places the heel higher up off the ground.  The grip vs wear also seems to favor longer lasting wear though grip on the hard courts that I play on has never been an issue.  The shoe does feel bulkier with more padding in the uppers and the heel cup can rub the back of the achilles slightly.  I do not feel that the heel reinforcement is as strong as the NB804/6 series since it does not have that hard heel cup, so I would suggest not to slip on the shoes without undoing the laces first as this one is easier to collapse.
It took me about 90 minutes to adjust to this shoe before it faded into the background and I no longer thought about it.  So from a replacement point of view, it is not a direct replacement for the NB804/6, but I would re-order this shoe in a 1/2 size larger next time.  Construction and quality wise, it is as good as the NB804/6, the lower price seals the deal.  I've been converted.","Very different from the NB804/6 series, but I've been converted",4.0,B0000A52UF

I think NB tennis shoes have a reputation for being low to the ground, and my 803s were indeed lower than these K-Swiss.  They fit fine, length and width and the toe box was good.

Great fit, great support, great ventilation, etc.  I was referred to the Ultrascendor as a replacement for the Defier, but I don't really care for the shoe.  Unfortunately, I bought two pair.  I don't feel the same support, my feet sweat much more, and the material seems flimsy compared to the Defier.  I've got to seek out a different shoe.  They look pretty good and are an OK shoe, but definitely not as good as the Defier.",Not a Good Replacement for the Defier Line,2.0,B0000A52UF

"I feel the width is more C width than a DC width.  I will not be buying the Ultrascendor tennis shoe again as I feel I need a full D width or more rounded toe.  The shoe appears to be of excellent quality except for its width.

I need a shoe with a full ""D"" width.  The ""C"" width is a little tight.

"It's the first time when I bought this type of shoe, but I'm telling you, I love it; comfortable, cool, nice, I can't take eyes off them;  Yes I'm talking about ""CONVERSE"" by Chuck Taylor, baby.",Chuck rullz,5.0,B0000A6XS9
"Converse Chuck Taylor All Stars are not just a fashion statement. Back in the day, they were my choice of athletic footwear -- following in my father's footsteps -- while starting center on the high school basketball team. For a 6'2"" white guy with a moderate vertical leaping ability, I didn't have to worry about losing any spring in my step, and I always led stats in rebounds and blocked shots against players wearing the then-ubiquitous Adidas, Puma and Converse ""Dr. J"" hi-tops. In all fairness, and as a disclaimer, 80% of the opposing team members were white guys, too.

Still, though I have absolutely no vertical leap left (hey. I graduated 24 years ago), I still wear these shoes, just because. Like one reviewer pointed out, they're a great conversation starter. Plus, they're as comfy as a second pair of feet.

At the turn of the 20th to the 21st century, it appeared that there'd be NO Chucks left at all: The Massachusetts factory was closing down, and Chucks appeared to be going the way of acid-wash jeans. Fortunately (or, unfortunately, if you're a member of the garment workers' union), Converse went through some reorganization and now makes these overseas, presumably in China.

Well, I'm boycotting the People's Republic of China, an anti-labor country that has helped more American CEOs bust unions than just about anyone else. Its own people are slave labor. Fortunately, I thought ahead, so when Converse was on the ropes, I went out to every shoe store around and bought up all the size 12 hi tops I could find. To be exact, 143 pairs -- a closet full. I've got 'em in white, optical white, green, red, basic black, navy blue, yellow, orange, you name it. Set me back $2700, but was worth every penny, knowing that American workers made them.

I AM THE IMELDA MARCOS OF CONVERSE CHUCK TAYLOR ALL-STAR SHOES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

But, if you're a newcomer to them, or missed the boat, I won't hate ya for buying these for yourselves. They are so cool, I'll look the other way.

I have to look the other way myself: I buy the toddler sizes for my two wittle one. Aw!!!! :) At least I help keep American shoe store employees employed, if not factory workers.",Five Star All Stars,5.0,B0000A6XS9

"This is one of the most comfortable shoes or sandal I have ever owned. I first saw these on some ultralight backpackers I met in 2005, and they swore by them for comfort and strong enough to climb rough terrain. For a sandal, that just blew me away. I confess I have not used them to backpack, but I have used them on rough terrain and they are outstanding and amazingly ""grippy"". It has little nubs on the carbon outer sole that dig into or grip everything.
SIZING:  I have read that most people find that they need to buy a half size larger than they do with other shoes, and that was my experience as well.
COMFORT: Tremendous arch support. The sandal has a wide toebox so that your toes are not cramped together, and the protective toe guard is great. I never stub a toe or catch a toe on anything with these, plus I can hide my ugly toes. It also has a little rise on the rear heel that cups your heel comfortably, but helps protect you against those people that step on the back of your foot in line. The sandal feels very secure once it is on and does not slip. There are no straps to fool with or Velcro to adjust, it has an inner lining that looks like the neoprene on a scuba suit, it stretches to fit. The rear strap does not hurt your foot. It has a no lace closure and you set it once, from then on it slips on easy. The footbed cradles my foot like no shoe I have ever seen. There is a little ridge on the inner sole that runs behind the toes and then in between your big toe and other toes, it turns out to add to the comfort of the shoe immensely. That ridge forms in a short time to your foot, giving you your own custom fit. With these shoes I find i can stand longer and walk longer.
GRIP AND TRACTION: It has an anatomical outer sole that is very grippy, with a nice athletic shape, it gives good traction on sand, rock, mud, you name it. It is not slippery on wet surfaces like the dock, and the sole does not leave any marks on floors. The tread does not hold dirt in any grooves to track indoors. It is great for water use, and can be completely submerged with no damage. If it gets wet,the material that wicks the water away fast.
ODOR: It has an anti-microbial treatment that takes away any germs, I do not know how long that treatment lasts though. They do not get sweaty or smelly like my Crocs do.
DURABILITY: I got my money's worth out of them for sure. When my H2's get dirty, I throw them in the sink, under the hose, or even in the washer and they come out like new. I wore these almost daily for 4 months straight with no evidence of wear. It has now been 4 years and I still use them more than any other shoe in the summer. I hope they are still made as durable as they were when I bought mine. This includes vacation, in which I am standing in line all day at theme parks and scrambling at the beach. These come in many colors. For a dressier sandal I also like the brown Dunham Moose Fisherman (actually designed by New Balance). These sandals were good enough to get me to buy two tennis shoes from the same company in the last 4 years, an in-town shoe called Austin and an ugly hiker called the Targhee II. In the end, I just can't say enough about these shoes, I highly recommend.",Best comfort and durability I have ever seen in a sandal,5.0,B0000DYKET

I bought a pair and have not taken them off since. Easy to slip on and off these are the perfect pair for someone on the go. The unique toe guard protects your feet like no other sandal of this type.

"This was my 3rd pair of this same model over the last dozen or so years.  My first pair are still usable but the sole has been worn smooth.  My last pair are still doing ok, but one of the leather straps is separating from the sole.  For 8 years of good service, that's just fine.

The uppers on the new pair seem just a little snug, but the sole is just right for my size.  I actually like having the elastic uppers being snug since I know they will [and already have] loosen up.

These are my favorite footwear from May to October for outside use, and well beyond for inside use.  They last a long time, are comfortable, look great and are a great value for the cost.

Took these to key west. I get cramps a lot in my Cressies and was looking for a split fin to try and cut down on the debilitating and time draining cramping while diving. Most of the fin that initially attracted me were shorter so I was unsure with the length on these which is similar to my existing fins. Based on the reviews on different sites I decided to give these a try and although we did have some drift I did notice a big difference and did not cramp up at all. I hardly noticed that they were even on when in the water and am super excited about reducing the possibility of leg cramps in the future now that I have these bad boys. They are expensive but you get what you pay for and in this case I feel the investment was well worth it. I also saved on the manufacturer advertised price so in my mind this was a win win.

"5 stars. This shoe has an amazing heel - I guess made from some sort of gel/carbon. For a heel striker like me, the landing feels rock solid and stable. Then the outsole under the carbon/gel heel is carbon rubber, and you can feel the traction working well.

Very good cushioning all through the midsole.
Good snug - but not tight - fit around the foot.
Good quality upper, with a mix of fabric and I'm guessing synthetic leather...looks nice too.
Works well for a neutral/underpronater/supinator like me.

With the laces, you could ""customize"" the tightness throughout the shoe, giving you a better fit.

"I use the amazing Miura (lace-up) exclusively. I've had 5.10 before, and tried on 11 other pairs (Evolv, Scarpa, etc.) before settling on these. I was holding off due to the price, and ended up wasting an hour fooling with inferior designs and lower-quality materials when I should have just gone with these to begin with. I bought my first pair four years ago and haven't found anything better. I own two pairs now, and alternate depending on what I'm doing.

Pros
* Superb fit: the arch, heel and tongue shrinkwrap to my foot, and I essentially forget I'm wearing climbing shoes
* Sensitivity is fine. There's no searching for the jib or cleft
* Protection is great. I can point, hook and edge all day with no concerns
* Lacing system, though a bit odd at first, is fast, easy, and hasn't blown out an eyelet or lace path
* Laces seem to have some tougher material woven into them... they are tough and despite hundreds of lace-ups, they haven't frayed or snapped... they appear to be capable of enduring for the life of the shoe
* Edge rubber is firmer and the toe rubber is softer, like a bighorn sheep's hoof
* Lining holds up fine -- no pilling, tearing, moisture issues or general disintegration
* Rand is durable and despite a few wear spots, is holding up well with no blowouts or expanding holes
* Double heel loops to make fitting faster and reduce wear on a single loop. The loops are also offset so they don't rub the achilles' tendon
* Initial size is maintained throughout its life. I consider this a pro, while some might want some stretch. Just know that you're getting a lined shoe and it's going to stay true to size

Cons
* One of the most expensive climbing shoes... but ooh what you can do in it...
* The toebox is a bit big, even when my foot is at full downturn on a steep overhang. It doesn't bug me, but it does require exact sizing to minimize the bulk
* Smearing is.... OK. If you really like to toe-smear, look for something less downturned. These will probably change your style (I have seen this in my wear patterns across the two most recent pairs I own)
* When it gets wet, the heel can slip a bit, so I shake some foot powder in, before a session
* If you're a vegan, sorry... these are leather. Time to determine just how strong your resolve is... I did think about it, but given the feel of other shoes, compared to this perfect-for-me design, it was no contest

Other thoughts
My street shoe and hiking boot size is 10.5, which equates to a 44. I am most comfortable in a Miura 43, and can fit into 42.5 but they're tight enough to want to take them off during breaks. I feel that I can wear my 43s around for hours straight without feeling like I'll damage my toes, yet the shoes are perfectly ready to go, when i am. My 42.5s are reserved for use when the 43s go get resoled or are soaked, or I'm wanting optimum pointing and edging.

I can't wear La Sportiva's boots due to their characteristic narrowness, so I was surprised when these Miuras worked, and not just sort of worked, but more as if they were custom-made for me. I use these primarily on our indoor climbing wall, though I boulder on granite and sandstone in them as well. I can't make any recommendations for big-wall climbing in them, but given that Alex Honnold and Tommy Caldwell use them for that, well, I think that should fill in the blank.",Superb downturned all-arounder,5.0,B0000E678B

"I had a pair of these years ago when I was climbing more regularly, and used them for years.

Some people have had problems with quick delaminating--I haven't experienced anything of the sort, but will keep an eye out for it on this pair.

Like others have suggested, get these a size or a size and a half below your street shoes. Ideally, try them out in person before buying online, and go for a fit that is as snug as comfortable--like all leather shoes, these will stretch.",I love these shoes,5.0,B0000E678B

"I wear a street shoe size of US 12, Mens.
I initially bought these shoes at size 44.5, which equates to US size 11

The shoes felt snug, but not tight. And there was just a little bit of room for my big toe to move around. Honestly it was perfect and if I knew that they'd fit like that forever I would have kept that size. But I asked someone at my gym with these shoes and she said that over time, with sweat etc... the shoes will stretch a little bit. Based on that, I returned them and purchased a pair at size 44 (US 10.5). That size is right for me. The shoes are tight but not painfully so. Even new, I can wear them for 2 hours in the climbing gym before they start hurting very much.

Sizing aside, I can't say enough good things about the shoes in general. They feel strong and supportive, but I can still feel the holds, the quick laces make a custom snug-fit very easy, and unlike some other La Sportivas the stiff heel isn't so tall it jams into my ankle. The shape is slightly aggressive but still good for a long climbing session.

I've had a pair of intro level velcro shoes, then owned a pair of mid-level slippers, now I have these upper mid-level lace-ups. So far I like the lace-ups best but had I got these in velcro I imagine I'd be just as happy.

So, down-size at least 1 full size would be my recommendation. If you like your shoes to stay tight and last until you wear them out, I'd suggest going down 1.5 sizes like I did.","Great feel, and very easy on-off with the quick laces",4.0,B0000E678B
"I've been climbing for a couple years now (V6-V7s and 5.12s) and the Muira's either the VS or the lace has always performed better than expected.  If you're just starting out and want something that is comfortable and performs, this is it.  For those gym rats out there, these are awesome but you should check out the Muira VS's, they're just easier to get in and out of.

Don't even hesitate if you're on the fence and get these.  They are rated highly by outdoorgearlab and they are great.  Amazon has a great return/exchange policy so don't fret.  Also, these shoe do stretch, maybe half a size.",Awesome in every way.,5.0,B0000E678B
"I got these shoes prior to a big DWS trip, and they were too big. Beware they are sized at least a half size larger than most climbing shoes I've tried (granted I was always in budget shoes before). These are very comfortable, and the heel does not dig into the achilles like many similar shoes - La Sportiva is good about that. The straps are great, and the rubber is super sticky and stays that way. These are kind of a magnet for pebbles for some reason (if you climb over gravel ever).

One thing to beware of is the toe box is way too high. It allows your big toe particularly to rub upwards on the outside of the toe, and puts a huge pressure point there. Not a huge problem or terribly painful, but annoying and unnecessary - the toe box could just be lower. ""But that just means you're not sizing down enough..."" No, the rest of the shoe is the most perfect fit ever, and a smaller fit would in no other way help anything to do with their performance - in LS's credit this is a VERY nice stiff shoe.

Overall I'm still very pleased. Definitely getting what I paid for in terms of comfort and performance - just that one gripe.

"I'm really just breaking these in so this should not be considered a durability review. But these are the perfect shoe for an intermediate climber. I wanted to be able to climb past my ability as I look forward to progressing in my climbing, but I also wanted something that would fit my feet... not grind them into salsa! These shoes were the answer, I have been climbing for 3 years, I love these shoes, Hell no I wouldn't walk around the house in them, but they are awesome for a day at the gym!

Last week I sprained my ankle, when my fiance wanted to go climbing I said I should be able to belay her but I wasn't looking forward to actually using my foot... however when I got to the gym I wanted to get on the wall just to see how it felt. The support of the shoes were phenomenal... I ended up climbing a 5.10+ With no problem... Literally the shoes prevented me from realizing I had a sprained ankle!

"Just outstanding. I climbed for 8 years in London's Westway Wall, 4 days a week, 3 hours a day. I tried maybe 5 different pairs of shoes in the early days until I hit on these. I hate laces, so love the velcro straps. I climbed 6C through the odd 7B and always felt the shoes were great. They grip anything well and are comfortable. Yes, if you overtighten them, the rear will dig into your Achilles a little. Also, the velro straps come a little long so I have to cut maybe 1 inch off each - but they are designed to be cut to length and the stitching doesn't come out.
To me they are the perfect mix of comfort and performance. Even after 200 outings, they still look ok and not too beat up.
The toes go first always for me - I think I am on my 7th pair. But they last plenty long enough and you feel these toeless old friends have paid their dues.
It's time to get my sons onto Lover's Leap in Tahoe where I live now, so I searched for these shoes and just bought 2 new pairs.

Ill update later on that. however the quality is pretty nice; the only common issue I've had with some of the bad reviewers is that awkward extra heel space. I didn't like it at first but the extra heel space actually isn't as much of a burden as you might think, you just have to learn how to work with it and its actually quite comfortable.",These shoes got a lot of bad reviews for some reason,3.0,B0000E6703
"One point to note is that the actual EURO size to US size is incorrect. I purchased a 41.5 EURO which was a 8.5 US but La Sportiva sizes it as an 8 UK and 9 US. Compared to my size 8.5 FiveTen Gallileos, these 41.5 Katanas were truly a size 9 US. If you want to go a half to full size street shoe size lower, I suggest take a full size off from the Amazon chart. For a size 8 US, go to a 40 EURO for the Katanas.

Despite being my street shoe size, the Katanas are still a great shoe. They have a break-in period of roughly 2-3 days for me, bouldering for 4hrs from V0 to V5 routes. The rubber has a sheen that needs to be worn off, they will be very slippery initially on the wall but will begin to start sticking very well over time. Compared to my FiveTen Gallileos, these are narrower with better rubber and still just as comfortable. I wear a brace on my left ankle and it was able to accommodate the extra layer yet not be detrimental to how the shoe was positioned and fit. For heel and toe hooks, I've found these shoes to perform very well. I'm also able to catch smaller foot holds better and edge much more aggressively. A slight drawback is that they don't smear as well as my FiveTens. The velcro straps also feel thinner and more brittle.

Overall a great shoe which would have been even better if I had them in my desired size.",Stick it!,5.0,B0000E6703

"I am a beginner climber, I do a lot of indoor and outdoor bouldering, and occasionaly top rope sport climbing.  I also have very narrow feet, so I tried on and purchased 6 different pairs of climbing shoes before I finally found one that fit my narrow feet well.

The rubber on these is confidence inspiring, and lets you stick to both indoor and outdoor rock walls with no problems.  The toe is pointed enough to get into small holes.  They are not super aggressive, but I would consider them an intermediate climbers shoe.

I wear a 10.5 in street shoes, and 42.5 fit me well.  42 for me was way too tight, but you definitely want to try on multiple sizes.

"I work in varying manufacturing environments.  Always on concrete and typically 10-12 hours a day - up to 7 days a week.  Weeks at a time.  Like others I have had the tired and sore feet, achy knees, etc, from this type of work.

I have probably bought nearly every boot out there from numerous companies over the years in search of relief.  Did the inserts.  One day I walked into the boot store in Sheldon Missouri coming back from a morning hunting trip to nose around.  Was just looking around and mentioned I was in search of the perfect boot for concrete.  He came right out with the rockies.  Salesman stated it was the most popular shoe at the local 3M plant in Nevada MO.  Tried on a pair in the store and was instantly sold.  This was in 2005.

The boots are a bit unique.  The soles are a bit spongy and this is where I think the comfort/relief comes from.  You can actually squeeze the sole and notice this.  The insoles are quality as well.  The leather is soft.  For me there is no feeling of breaking the boots in like with my Red Wings.

In my opinion these boots are made for putting miles on them - hence the postal approved status.  I do not wear these doing outdoor work as the leather is a bit too soft for that.  I wear my Red Wings for the rough stuff.  Danner Pronghorns and Mucks for hunting.  They used to be available in brown but now it is only black.  I have both the safety toe and non-safety toe.  The composite toe is the only safety boot I have worn that did not kill my toes.

To make a long story longer - this is the only boot I will wear on concrete.  You will notice the comfort the first time you wear them to work.  I keep them polished and typically replace the insole with a new factory one every six months due to the long hours I put in.

Do not fall victim to these boots like I did. I read all the reviews before purchasing and carefully selected these based on reviews as well as ratings. I was very excited when they arrived.  Very well packaged by the way and on time. I looked them over tried them on everything seemed ok.  My very first hour out in the mountains I noticed my left foot was wet.  I looked down and seen a big hole at the seam of the boot where it meets the sole.  By the time I got back to the truck the hole was even bigger.  I was very dissatisfied.  I contacted the seller and low and behold I only receive a $20 discount.  Now I have $126 boots that are tore up in only 5 hours use and I'm out on returning them back because I wore them.  Just another pair of boots to throw out in the garage box with the rest of the junk.  Very deceiving.  I would not recommend these boots to anyone.  When asked by them I had to justify myself and the boots with pictures.  It took over 2 weeks to get $20 back on the purchase.,Very Dissatisfied!,1.0,B0001KX7ZY

"MADE IN CHINA. Should have known better. My husband bought a pair of similarly styled Rocky boots in the early 2000s and absolutely loved them because they were so warm. He only uses them during hunting season and is careful with them, keeping them clean, etc. Even the leather uppers, liners, shoelaces and soles were nearly perfect. Admittedly, a dozen years may seem like a long time, but when a shoe is barely worn, I expect better. This year, the ENTIRE TOP OF EACH BOOT COMPLETELY SEPARATED from the rubber sole. I discovered the manufacturer must not have any faith in their boots either because of their relatively short warranty stipulations. For the amount of hours these boots were actually worn, my husband figures he wore them maybe two weeks. He has much older pairs of hunting boots that date back to the 1970s, and although they are beat up, none have done this. Really disappointed.

"I have been a fan of FiveTen and Stealth rubber for well over a decade. I recently purchased the ""Guide"" and I can honestly say that these are the best hiking shoes that I have ever owned. Comfort, performance, and durability rolled into one shoe. I am an avid hiker. I live just outside of Rocky Mountain National Park, in the Colorado Rockies. The predominant surface on the majority of trails is rock. The ""Stealth C4 Rubber"" is amazing, and greatly decreases the chance of slips or falls. If you are serious about your hiking and are on rocky terrain, I would highly recommend this, or a similar FiveTen shoe!","Comfort, Perfomance, and Durability in One Shoe...",5.0,B0001PFQ6W
"just got them today and had to try em right out of the box on a 3 mile desert hike with easy to moderate uphills and downhills comprised of stretches of loose dirt, gravel, scree loose rock packed dirt and i don't know how they grip so well on the loose stuff.  i got them for summer use as my favorite merrell sawtooths are a little warm.  i was concerned about ankle support but no problems and i hauled my usual 40 lbs 3 day pack.
wore them to my kids high school baseball game and got compliments from parents and kids and asked what brand they were and how to get them.  the younger teens recognized them from parcour/freerunners who use them a lot.
i will buy a second pair maybe in canvas this time
ps i wear a size 9.5 i got the size 10 and they have enough room for superfeet insoles and thick socks
and they are a light olive drab but turned to desert tan after the first hike (he he)
best price ive found is 84.95 with free shipping

"I'm definitely not a hiker. What I am is a city-dweller who is on his feet a lot. I'm also becoming a frickin' old man, so my feet get cranky and comfortable footwear has become increasingly important. I bought these shoes because even the less than stellar reviews indicated that they are very comfortable, and because I like the overall looks a lot. I am not disappointed. These shoes feel true to size (11D), and are ridiculously comfortable. Definitely something I can wear all day. They also look great, in my humble opinion. Regarding the color, however, it should be mentioned that these shoes are very, very green -- not at all the lighter khaki shade in the product images (I believe the color I purchased is even called ""Khaki""). They're green, dude. But they're still attractive shoes. I have no clue how they'd hold up to serious hiking, because I don't do that stuff. For walking around, though? Time will tell. They look/feel very well constructed and sturdy. If they hold up, I'll eventually buy another pair.","Amazingly Comfortable, Though Quite Green",5.0,B0001PFQ6W
"I like this shoe a lot. I spent five weeks backpacking through European cities wearing only this shoe. But there is one major issue you should know about. It is a stiff approach shoe. This means that if you're not on soft woodland trails it wears on you like stone. There is almost no padding in the footbed. It held up great and continues to be in terrific shape. Best looking shoe of its kind. and I easily waterproofed it. I added a ""sports"" insole and that did the trick. Great shoe. Could really use much better built in padding.

"The new cut of the Garmont XCRs no longer fits me (too small) after wearing Garmonts for 20+ years. Had to return those to Amazon. Still miss the Sticky Walkers, though. After much browsing found these instead and ordered a pair.

Zappos recommended ordering 1/2 size larger than normal, so I chose the 13.5 size. Fit is perfect and shoe is really comfortable, PLUS much lighter than the Garmonts. Even though these shoes are not officially waterproof, my socks remained dry after several walks in wet weather/terrain in Sonoma County.

Traction is great in all conditions: wet rocks, concrete, mud, sand, even metal grates.

So far, I've used them for lots of urban strolling and moderate country walks. Going to mtns of central PA next week where they will get a much more thorough workout at World's End, Loyalsock Trail and Rickett's Glen.

"This is my first time to purchase this brand as it is not available in my neck of the woods (Philippines).  The only brands of approach shoes available here are Columbia, North Face, Teva, and a few from Adidas & Salomon, but the selections are scarce and often very pricey.  So I took a a gamble on FiveTen since most of the reviews I've read have been positive, and boy am I glad I did!

The one and only pair of approach shoes I've owned were from Adidas.  It was part of their Adventure line (I cannot recall the model name since it was so freakin' long; here's a pic [...]  They were the most comfortable pair of shoes I've owned at that point in my life and I practically wore it everyday until I wore out the sole.  The soles were so smooth that I would slip even though I was hardly moving.  Sadly I had to retire the pair and have been looking for something similar ever since.  That was back in 2008.  5 years later I have finally found a pair that lives up to (or may even exceed) the performance of that old Adidas Adventure.

These Five Tens started out stiff (but not hard), something you would expect from a pair that is designed to be rugged.  But after a few hours of wearing them it became more flexible and your feet kinda gets used to shape of the shoe.  The grip is fantastic (thanks to its Stealth Rubber sole) and the fabric feels sturdy.  They seem to be constructed well, only time will tell if these are built to last.  But as of now I am loving evey minute these shoes are on my feet!
Only negative about this purchase is that the color of the shoe is not the same as the one pictured in Amazon.  These are actually green (as mentioned also by another buyer in his review) and IMO looks better than the khaki-beige in the pic.  But thats just me, other buyers may feel differently.

Overall a very good buy considering the fact that I paid less than $80 for it.  Most appoach shoes cost more than $100.","Not the same color as in the pic, but I actually like this greenish khaki shade better!",5.0,B0001PFQ6W

"I worked at an indoor climbing wall for 3 years and this was the only shoe I needed or wanted. Here's why.
1. The rubber is as a fantastic blend of sticky and durable. Like I said: 3 years. Never re-soled them. Never had traction problems.
2. They are VERY comfortable for a climbing shoe. If you're going to be spending a lot of time in your shoes, go with these. If you're going to slip on shoes for a quick climb then take them right back off, you could go with something more curvy/aggressive/uncomfortable. That being said, these are still adequate for almost any climb.

Some additional advice: be ready to buy new laces. If you use them/abuse them enough, the laces that they come with these are going to wear out (WAY before the shoe itself ever does). Also, see if you can find a local store (they usually mark them up) that sells them. Start sizing them. Try them on without socks and then remember the size that your feet can BARELY fit into. That's the size you want. After wearing them for a while, the leather will stretch and fit to your foot. Happy climbing and be safe!",Worked at a climbing wall for 3 years.

"I am a beginner climber. I am more advanced than most beginners but I don't have enough time on a wall to say I am more than a beginner. That being said, I probably have put these shoes through more than most beginners and find that they are sufficient for any beginner. From smearing to heel hooks, these seem to do the trick. What I cannot say is whether they are a great shoe. I have not tried on enough ""expensive"" shoes to compare these to them. I CAN say that they are better than ANY gym rental that I have tried on. I bought half size smaller than my street shoe size and they were a little snug at first (which was not bad) and slowly broke in to feeling perfect. I have a wider foot than average with long toes. My toes were able to squish down in the box comfortably while the sides of my foot were accommodated by ability to lace all the way down to the heads of my metatarsals. If you are a beginner and have an ""odd"" shaped foot like mine, these will be good shoes. I do a lot of climbing/bouldering on the beach (I live in Nor-Cal) and the only downfall to the lacing is that sand creeps in the toes. If you spend more time on the rocks than the sand, you won't have any issues having to take them off to get the sand out of your toes!

"I've been renting Nomads from my gym for 4-5 months, and finally decided to take the plunge and get my own shoes.

First time out, I ordered a 6.5, because I've been renting 8s from my gym, and the Mad Rock website said a women's 8=men's 6.5 (I'm female). VERY snug, very short, and I will probably be wearing something that tight in a couple of years when my climbing has leveled up, but for now, they're just too darn tight. Send them back and ordered a size up.

Second time up, I got a 7, and they were still pretty snug, but wearable. I was figuring I'd keep them, and let the leather stretch, but the leather ripped after only two hours on the wall. So back they went.

This time, I did what I should have the first time, and matched the european sizes of my rentals with the ones I was buying. Eureka! These are snug but not tight, and I can wear them for hours without pain. The soles are stiff and sticky, so I can edge on tinier, slipperier holds than I'd been able to when wearing the Nomads (which are great, but they're pretty well-worn as rental shoes).

"As a climber who has had many foot issues, these shoes worked surprisingly well. I have had bunion surgery on both of my feet, so I have had my share of shoe problems. Normally, I would wear orthotics, but clearly, this isn't possible in a climbing shoe.

I chose these shoes because the laces go all the way to the tip giving the maximum amount of flexibility for adjusting to my feet. I was very happy with the fit. I've worn a good handful of climbing shoes, and I don't think I'd purchase any others after this.

I will say that, despite having the ability to adjust them, my feet get tired after wearing them for a short while. I'm not sure how I'd handle wearing them for hours on end, but I have a feeling that most other climbing shoes would be worse than these on my feet.

"I got a lot of compliments on how good these shoes looked on me in the first couple weeks. Though after about a month of wearing these shoes only semi-regularly (only in buildings and occasionally outdoors) they looked like they had been worn everyday for years, with dirt and smudges all over, not just visible on the white tips/logo. About three months, in, and the material inside both shoes are peeling and I can feel it with my toes. About a quarter of the logo has rubbed off. Another thing that I ended up disliking about this shoe, despite my desire to love them, is how hard they are to get on and off. I need to untie the laces and loosen them all the way every time I take them off, and of course this means tying them when I put them back on. They're pretty comfortable still, that's a plus, and they still look all right, but JUST all right, not very good anymore. They laces are also EXTREMELY long, but that might just be because my feet are narrow.",Looks great... at first,3.0,B0001Y8YBW

"Overall, Chuck's are a comfortable, ergonomic, and sustainable choice for footwear. I prefer the Hi-tops over the lower style because the longer laces can be finely adjusted to a snug fit without any pinching at the instep. There's also no chaffing at the back of the heel as can sometimes happen with low sneakers. Compared to cushioned running shoes the canvas keeps my feet cooler and I feel that the flat soles are better for my feet.

The sizing codes are a frequent source of confusion - they refer to the width only. Here's a quick guide: Narrow width is labeled as AA for women and C for men; Medium width is labeled as B for women and D for men; Wide shoes are labeled C or D for women and E for men; Extra wide is labeled E for women and EE for men. So, the medium with is most common, and they are often listed as B(M) for women and D(M) for men - in both cases the M stands for medium width. If you see UK after the size then it's using the British width system, where the scale is C, D, E, F, G, H, with F bring the medium. Regarding whether it's a women's size or men's the product info should state women's or men's (to avoid confusion with the width designations F or M). You can convert between US women's and men's sizes using the size chart link under the size. All of the UK sizes on Amazon are for UK men (same as US men in most cases) use the size chart if you want to see the equivalent size for US women. Still with me?!

You can now recycle your old Chuck's at many Nike stores. The rubber will end up in tracks and playgrounds and the canvas in courts. Tip: their online store locator doesn't seem to be accurate in terms of listing stores with drop-off locations. I called a SF store that didn't have a recycling drop-off according to the website and it turned out that they actually did. So just call your local Nike store!

There's a lot of evidence now that being closer to barefoot (minimal cushioning and little or no elevation at the heel) is much better for your feet. For example, research shows that when running in highly-cushioned modern running shoes, people are more likely to come down on their heels, and that these heel-strikes can be very high-impact (Lieberman, Nature 2010). Converse (along with Tom's, Vibram, etc.) fit the bill for a close-to-barefoot shoe experience that will help keep your feet in shape. I once had an injury and was advised to wear arch-supporting insoles (which I wore in my Converse), but after recovery I took out the insoles (and only occasionally wear trainers with cushioned insoles) since the ""arch-support"" can lead to muscle atrophy and, ironically, loss of arches.

Perhaps it's sad that Nike bought Converse in 2003 and moved production overseas (Indonesia, China, Vietnam, Thailand, and other locations) since Nike has a dark past when it comes to conditions in overseas factories. They are clearly working on this since the boycotts and outrage in the 90's, but the situation is still not perfect. As of 2011, two-thirds of the 168 factories failed to meet Nike's own standards for contract manufacturing (for example, there were reports of kicking, slapping, verbal abuse, and cruel work environments).  I think they are trying to be more transparent about worker conditions since they've been under the spotlight more than some of their competitors (like Adidas). However, this clearly needs to change, and quickly.

In terms of materials, the canvas and synthetic rubber composition puts Converse above average in terms of sustainability. There is room for improvement of course. For example, Veja shoes (ranked higher on Rankabrand), have better worker conditions and are more eco-friendly; they're made using organic canvas and natural rubber that's sustainably harvested in the Chico Mendes reserve in the Amazon. I plan to try them out; they're available through an Amazon company called Great Dane. Meanwhile, I love Converse as a product and hope that Nike will sort out their factory conditions situation. Nike (in 2011) claimed that they work working on it but that there was little that they could do to stop it. Let's get this straight, Nike: You buy the Converse company, shift production oversees where workers are abused and paid barely enough for food and lodging (less than $0.50 per hour), while maintaining the same price for the shoes to the consumer, and yet claim that you can't do anything about the conditions?  They are under contract to you - I'm pretty sure you can do something.

So, overall I'll give it 5 stars gold stars for quality of the product and 4 ""green"" stars based on the social-ethical-environmental aspects of producing it. Converse was a great company but under Nike it loses a green star for poor working conditions in overseas factories. To put it into perspective (why do they only lose one star for bad conditions in some factories?), Nike are not as bad as some of the other big shoe companies, judging from available information. It looks like they are being transparent about the situation and their attempts to improve it (training managers, inspecting facilities, and revising subcontracts). Back in 2005 it became the first major apparel company to disclose factory locations and with that came some ugly stories about worker treatment, but perhaps not as ugly as the stories leaking out of more secretive companies like Adidas or Skechers. The materials used to make Chuck's together with recycling efforts from Nike warrants a 4 star rating, to be revised based on updates on worker conditions.",I've been wearing them for over 20 years and my feet are happy!

"Let me start by saying that I've worn a fair amount of western style boots and hold them to a higher standard than most. Realistically, I'd give these a 4.5 star review.

Comfort/fit:
These bad boys are comfortable! I have a pretty wide foot, but i did not feel like these required a lot of break in time. My job requires me to do a lot of walking, up to 10 miles a day, and my feet always felt great. I've even jumped of high retaining walls and the cushion in the Ariat souls are awesome. THEY DO HAVE A TALL HEEL, which is the case with most cowboy boots, so be aware that. I'm 6'1, 190ibs, medium/large width foot and a size 10.5 - these things feel great.

Durability:
I wore these boots nearly everyday for a year and a half. Working 10+ hour days and dancing in them a few times a week (not the best for dancing because the bottom is pretty grippy, but they'll do the job). They held up pretty well. Unfortunately, my job requires me to use chemicals that are very hard on leather, I didn't keep them polished, and the side ended up splitting. KEEP THEM POLISHED and they will last a long time. I bought another pair very similar to these right after they wore out.

Style:
Great style, you will get compliments on them. Especially if you polish them, they get really shiny. Plenty of western style, without being too flashy.

All and all, these are a great boot. Keep them polished and you will be very happy.",4.5 - GOOD BOOTS - KEEP THEM POLISHED,4.0,B00024QTFO

"I ordered these boots for my dad, who is impossible to please. He is very fussy about his boots, and they needed to be:

black, not too shiny, not have an advertising logo visible, be unlined (just leather, so he can wear them in summer), have classic styling and stitching, rounded toe, not too grippy on bottom, but not absolutely slick, have no leather ""by-products"", go up high enough on his leg, and fit under his jeans. We actually found something close to custom order - for about $250-300, non-returnable (Did I mention they couldn't be more than $150?). Not only would that seem impossible to find, but he needed them to be available in extra-wide sizes because I guess his feet are a bizarre shape. AND he wanted them by next week, since his ""work sneakers"" were falling apart at the seams. He wanted these to be his work boots.

I received the boots within a few days, and gave them to my dad, who slipped his feet in and lit up. I checked in a few days later and he said they're so perfect he almost doesn't want to wear them to work - they're just too nice. I did see he wore them to church a few days ago. The impossible to satisfy was finally satisfied by these boots - so I HIGHLY recommend these to any man looking for a comfortable, durable, attractive classic leather boot.

"My feet are probably shaped like trapazoids, so I always have a difficult times with shoes, workboots, and athletic shoes. If I found a pair that did fit, they would have wear / pressure points shortly after wearing in.

I would never be able to fit into a standard pointy toe cowboy boot.
I previously had a basic Justin Roper that had worn out.

With these Ariats, a 8D width was to narrow at fitting. I did purchase a 8EE, which seemed a but snug putting on and off for a while, but is perfect now.

After 7 years, I've been very happy and praise the comfort and durability. I would be happy at buying the exact same replacement. But they're in great condition, I'm actually shopping for just a replacement footbed ""insert"" because the heel cushion is wearing through. (still available and only $20)

The leather on the toe has some scrapes and is slightly worn down, but really only needs to have some polish. The sole are excellent, have a wonderfull forefoot pattern, and have an amazing solid arch. The heals are still in excellent condition.

Normally my foot would wear out the interior leather or fabric of a shoe / boot, especially in the forefoot or around the sides of the heal. The only slight interior deterioration these boots have would be the upper interior fabric from flexing against my foot as they bend and I'm crawling on my toes... I bend, squat, kneel, and croutch down alot and I've had these boots since my kids were toddlers.

The roper boots may not have the ""pop"" and flash as other styles, but I have worn these dancing. These may not slide as much on the dancefloor since they have a great forefoot traction, but do well enough... I have occationally worn these motorcycle riding (street)on nice days. You will need to have your foot firmly planted to hold the ballanced weight of a bike. I prefer boots with heavier ankle support, and softer soul with more grip than what these offer... especially stopping on country roads with unlevel surfaces and road debrie.

"I have such a hard time finding footwear that fits because my feet are 4E wide.  I gave up trying to find comfortable cowboy boots many years ago.  Quite by accident I found these boots and even though they are 2E wide they fit as well as running shoes.  The leather is not stiff and the soles are good looking black rubber.

It's nice to be able to wear good looking boots again for every day footwear instead of some ugly lace up cross trainers.  I'm buying this pair as a backup for the first pair that I bought at a boot store last year.  Those boots are still good, but they've been abused a bit and I want a nice pair that is not all scratched and beat from working outside.

I especially like the low heel.  I just can't pull off the pointy toe, high heel boot look anymore.  These boots are just right.",Comfortable Classic,5.0,B00024QWGK
"These boots are very comfortable and true to size.  This is my first pair of western boots and I was a bit worried about the narrow looking toe.  No problem because it is longer than a regular boot.

"These boots are really well made and the sole has some good cushioning when you walk.

I usually take a 10.5, and sometimes an 11.  I ordered 11 to be safe.  I literally popped my back the first time I tried to force them on.  Once they're on they fit snug, but fine and they're already stretching a bit and becoming a little easier to get on.  HOWEVER, the inside seam that runs up both sides of the shaft is HUGE, with sharp angled edges.  It's like having an old-school wooden pencil on each side, rubbing against your ankle bones.  Some ""designer"" should be taken out and shot.

I thought I should return them, but instead I did a McGyver.  I took a Dremel and ground down the heavy seam around where the ankle bone hits and rounded the sharp edges.  Now they're fine.  But no one should have to do this.  Not sure I'd buy them again.",... are really well made and the sole has some good cushioning when you walk,3.0,B00024QWGK

"The Ariat Mens Heritage Roper Western Cowboy Boot are ok boots. However, do not judge the book by its image. The boots as advertised look to be of more malleable, softer leather than what arrived. My experience with the boots were that they were much coarser and very difficult to break in. And they should not be worn in rain or snow as this will ruin them altogether. After a few weeks of wear I had to discard after once getting caught in a rainstorm. As they dried the leather upper hardened then began to crack around the toe bend areas when I again wore them. Obviously, only made to wear in dry weather.",Review of Ariat Mens Heritage Roper Western Cowboy Boot,2.0,B00024QWGK

"The Ariat Cascade is a well made and designed boot.

My current job is more standing and kneeling, so I had the boots cut down to 6"" and a slip resistant Vibram Wedge sole put on.

"I purchased these boots about 8 years ago and have finally worn them out.  I work in the garden year round almost every day and I have put them through some pretty rough treatment.  They've finally cracked all the way through at the back of the ankles. I've duct taped them over and over but it's time to get another pair.  What I love about them is because of the tight ankle fit they never slip off so I've never felt unsure or wobbly in them.  The foot treads are sturdy so I can wear them for 8 hours continually and my feet won't hurt or feel tired when I take them off. I even wore them on a ship once and I had to jump on deck from the dock platform.  I felt very sure footed and confident.

They don't come in ladies sizes though (bummer!  I have a very narrow foot and wear a 6 1/2 to maybe a size 7 shoe (depending on the maker  If you have a foot size similar to mine, buy the men's size 5 boot.  It will fit you perfectly.  I am looking forward to the next 8 years in my new boots, (or longer if I take better care of them.)

I will say that because of the tight ankle fit, that is probably why they cracked at seam at the back of the ankles. I used to step on the back of each heel to be able to get them off, not recommended.  I would suggest purchasing a boot jack to get them off because after a long day, your feet might get sweaty and they can be a little difficult to get off.  If I could justify spending $400 on a pair of Le Chameau Chasseur boots with the full length zipper, I'd buy those in a heartbeat, but I've got better things to do with my money and anyway, these Le Crosse boots have never let me down.

UPDATE  February 26, 2017.  Okay, I am ready to order another pair.  The previous ones lasted almost exactly two years.  The exterior is fine except for some minor cracks in the rubber.  The cracks haven't gone all the way thru but I notice the lining on the inside of one boot near my ankle has worn away completely so even with socks, I am starting to get a blister.

Both of these models have goretex liners with a heel counter (between the gortex & outside leather) to provide support to the heel (not talking about the ortho insert).  On the right side of the right foot at the front edge of the heel counter the Grouse boots had a pressure point on the bottom / edge of my foot (felt similar to a small rock in my shoe).  Wearing them around the house did not seem to ""break them in"" and I think my foot would end up quite sore after a hike in these boots.

"I have loved my Danner Rain Forest boots for years, but I was looking for a taller boot with more insulation. I have been wearing these Canadian boots for over a month now, in the hottest heat of the summer. It seems that Thinsulate keeps out the heat and adds padding, making these the most incredibly comfortable boots in the whole wide world. The leather is softer than what is used on the Rain Forest Brown, and break-in was minimal. The Danner Bob sole is absolutely amazing for soft uneven surfaces, but be aware that the soft rubber knobs will mark up a hard floor. The insulation might bunch up a little during break in, so be sure to reach inside the boot after wearing them and smooth the Thinsulate back into place. Once the leather and padding molds into the shape of your foot and calf, this won't likely be a problem but make sure to mind the creasing during the first month of wear to avoid pinch points. Same goes with the tongue, maybe use a shoehorn down the calf lacing to make sure the leather doesn't bunch up as you lace them. I would suggest ordering the Boot Dressing with these boots to help soften the tongue during break-in. So if you need a gorgeous, dark brown, rugged yet comfortable tall boot that will be almost exclusively worn outside in rough terrain, this is the boot for you. I should also mention that the waterproof quality of these boots is equal to that of the Rain Forest model. Be sure to treat the leather with waterproofing wax before walking through deep water.",The Best Boot I have Ever Worn without question,5.0,B0002L4BNO

"I have had this boot for over 15 years.  And all I do is put mink oil on it ever year and they retain themselves.  Recently I did not do this (last year) and a mouse got into the boot and either chewed a hole or the leather cracked.  I am certain this would have never happened if I would have used mink oil.  After all were talking 15 years.  So needless, to say the hole near the heel is not a good thing.  And to my knowledge cannot be repaired.  Also my heel could you replacement as the ""bubbles"" on the heel had worn out.  Danner offers to replace these for a fee.  Which is great!.

So I will be of course buying another of the exact same pair due to the hole in the heel.  I figured after 15 years, it may be time to retire my trust old pair.  If my memory serves me correct, I believe I spent $200 for a pair 15 years ago.  A great investment and well worth the $400 or so price today!",to say the hole near the heel is not a good thing.

"Leather Quality and workmanship is outstanding. However, I've had boots with as little as 400 gram that were much warmer than Canadian 600's. I even bought them a half size larger to accommodate more sock. It's almost as if the insulation wasn't installed. Worse than that and my perpetually cold feet, was Danner's sales job about this self cleaning sole, epic fail. They should have sold these soles as mud and snow attractant and regardless of foot shattering pounding, not all of snow/mud will release until you are standing somewhere you don't want it to fall off. One major note of warning, these soles are DANGEROUS when new and you get a little bit of fuel on them along with some moisture and you walk inside onto linoleum...

"Terrible boots from a very big name in the boot world. Very nice looking leather and the treads are perfect for snow and handle slick ice fairly well. Way better in ice then any LL bean boot however... These boots fell apart 2 weeks after I bought them with a total of maybe 20 hours of wear on a few small hunts. Mostly worn in upstate NY in the winter, I have never been comfortable in them. When it's very cold I wear 100% wool socks with them and my feet never stay warm. When its right around or a little above freezing my feet are roasting! The left boot has a slightly larger piece of leather on the top of the foot that folds as I was and hurts my foot. The leather on the toe is already worn down and the soul is coming off from the bottom of the shoe. I've never had a boot fall apart like this and before these boots I've never spent more then 130 dollars on a pair. Customer service was less then friendly and very suspicious of my claims.

Only on the early season sheep hunts do I switch my danners out for a mountaineering boot.

"I have been a Forest Ranger for 22 years and had two prior pairs of Danner Fort Lewis boots for my winter wear.  I wanted something with more insulation, and these fit the bill.  They are comfortable from day one, very warm in what has been one of our coldest winters in the northeast in a long time, and I am often outside all day long in remote areas. They give secure footing in all kinds of wilderness terrain, keep the feet warm & dry, and with the insert give much-needed relief for my back, which gets unforgiving with inferior footwear.

I love the height on these boots as they add extra protection from the elements.  Also, great stability around the ankle and heel for all day support and comfort.  Last, good traction for traversing uneven terrain.  Plus, Danner offers recrafting on these boots.  I've owned several Danner boots and.have taken advantage of the recrafting for prolonged yrs. of service.

"Having read so many glowing reviews for Danner boots for so long, I concluded that they must be the best US-made boots money can buy and determined to try a few. Having done so, I feel I can safely conclude that my assessment was correct, but that is as far as it goes, as I can also safely conclude now that those who are enamored of Danner boots are the type who insist on buying US-made products in general. Danner boots may well be the most durable US-made boots available (it is difficult to justify the huge price tags any other way), but they are also probably the most uncomfortable -- certainly they are the most uncomfortable I have ever worn. The Explorers had no support at all and felt as though I were walking around in a pair of leather-soled dress shoes, causing my feet to hurt after only a few miles of walking, as you would expect of a dress shoe. The Super Rain Forest (much like the Canadian 600 Gram Hunting Boot) had no padding for the collar and became the very first boot I have ever worn (over the course of some 25 years wearing boots) to cut my lower leg after only a few miles of walking. The Mountain Lights were so uncomfortable that I never even bothered to try to walk around outside in them.

The uber-patriots who patronize Danner will no doubt say that any truly  durable boot needs to be broken in, but for the prices Danner charges, I would say that it is not asking much for them to be comfortable right out of the box -- a claim often made concerning Danner boots, which I found to be false. More to the point, I suspect that the discomfort of Danner boots is a very big part of their appeal to right-wingers, as they no doubt consider it a badge of honor to suffer in the name of buying American-made, in general. Which is not to say that buying American-made is any way harmful (for a US Citizen), but for the ordinary consumer, there have to be limits to how far you will go to patronize your country in terms of the merchandise you buy. This review, by the way, is not intended to bad-mouth right-wingers, but to provide a rare objective take on Danner products, so that other consumers can be spared what I went through over the course of several months of trying out different styles & sizes of Danner boots; I just couldn't bring myself to accept the vast discrepancy between my personal experience with Danner boots and the endless glowing reviews.

For the record -- and for anyone not hung up on buying American-made -- I can personally highly recommend the Italian boot manufacturers (i.e., Zamberlan & Scarpa). They seem to really have it down to a science and manage to make boots that are not only highly durable and functional, but also extremely comfortable and even very stylish on occasion. Both Scarpa & Zamberlan specialize in mountaineering boots (as is to be expected of an Italian outdoor boot manufacturer), which means you wouldn't look to them for a decent work or hunting boot (Danner's specialty). It also means they are a better bet for a solid hiking boot, with Zamberlan having been at it for slightly longer than Danner (the oldest US outdoor boot manufacturer, so far as I know).",Danner: Strictly for Right-Wingers,2.0,B0002L4BNO

"Danner builds boots. Not jacket's or hats or underwear... Just boots, and they do an exceptional job of it. Certainly Danner's are not for everyone, just like a differnt motorcycle helmet manufacturers different brands fit different people. Danner's are narrow by design, and do tend to run a bit on the flat side in the arch.  But if they do fit your foot shape, you will never go back to anything else.

Acadia's are worn by most of the people who are out there protecting you every day.  Fire, police, and military personnel are the people who these boots, and in that task they meet all the requirements those professions demand. I've worn the Acadia since 1996 on my job as a professional firefighter/EMT and though I've tried a few other kinds of boots over the years; I always come back to the Acadia.  These boots have seen me through 200 degree ground on wildland fires ( NOTE- these do not meet current wildland specs any longer - boots must be full leather)HAZMAT incidents, and more muddy ditches on motor vehicle accident's than I can count.

Are these boots more expensive than a cheap pair of ""tactical"" boots? Yes, but with a pair of Danner boots you get the ability to have them reconditioned, as well as owning a boot that will outlast almost any other on the market, and they are made in the USA in Portland, Oregon.

"I have owned several pairs of Danner. Two Ft. Lewis (insulated) and two Acadia, prior to this purchase. They are my work boots. My oldest pair are 25years old, then 21, 17, and 10. The two oldest pair were worn on duty and then for training, when I replaced them with the other two (one Ft. Lewis and one Acadia). The newer of the four pair are still wearable but starting to show their age. I bought this pair (5th pair, which are Acadias), to hopefully carry me out to retirement (8 more years). Other than the quality, you can have these resoled. In the long term, the boots pay for themselves.

One of the down sides to Danner boots is that they are heavy, compared to other name brand boots. But you are getting quality. And being this is all I have worn, in my 25 years of service, I don't know anything else except that my boots last longer than my fellow workers, who buy different name brand boots. Another issue, is the break in period. It is a pain in the .....rear. You will cuss them for awhile, but once they break in, they are like a great fitting glove.

"I've ordered these before and they stood up great. But 3 months of wear of the new pair (I don't know if same manufacturer as the old) has revealed the sole is not suede as advertised, but a fast wearing fabric. Also, the knit upper is detaching from and curling away from the seams. This is not the quality I expected for the price paid!  I bought Acorn slippers instead, for twice the price, but at least Acorn is well made.

"After reading other comments, I bought one size up and they fit perfectly.  To be more precise, my shoe size is 11XW so I bought the XL/12.5 and they fit my 11 extra wide feet beautifully.  Also, unlike many others noted, they went on easily with the ankle just snug enough to hold the slippers on without slopping up and down.

"Whoever makes this product does not seem to realize that you no matter how wide you make the slipper part, if the foot-hole part where you stick your foot in is only a couple inches wide, then that's the biggest foot that can wear the slipper.  I bought the correct size for my feet, thinking they would fit.  It's true I have wide feet (not monstrously huge), but the stocking hole is ludicrously small - it stretches to maybe half the width of the slipper.  So my foot would fit just fine, if I could get it in there.  If the hole were as wide as the slipper, I could.  I was so angry and frustrated trying to get these on that in a rage I cut the back of the stocking to make it big enough.  Now I can't return them of course.

I figured that we would try them anyway, but 4 months after gifting them holes developed in the material at the toe. I have mended  them in hopes that we can keep them for a few more months this spring and in early autumn. However, this is the first pair that has not lasted until at least November. In the past I would darn them and just wait a few more weeks for the new pair to arrive. These will not last until summer. In addition, they do not ""breathe"" like the soles made of real suede.

While they are very comfortable (I only once got blisters, after hiking 18 miles up and down mountains in a day), they are nothing-proof. If it's below 40 F or windy, your feet will get cold. If it rains, they'll get wet, though they dry quickly. They did not completely protect my feet from impact (rocks etc), and eventually started to tear open in places, but they were significantly better than sandals. For warm weather, they're great, and if you use them for walking around rather than intense hiking and climbing they may last years.","Comfortable, can take hard use but won't last",4.0,B0002M13R0

"Is this a shoe? I went to a local store to find a new running shoe and tried on four pairs including the Omni 13. Every other pair felt like I was wearing shoes. I thought something was wrong with the Omni 13 at first because it did not feel like I was wearing shoes, but then I realized that this is what it's supposed to be like wearing shoes.

They're very comfortable for walking around in, but I doubt many of you are reading this for a review of these shoes for walking. I did go for a run today, the first with these shoes. I didn't feel like there was any break-in required other than wearing them about for two days beforehand (and I'm sure I could have run out of the store with them and be comfortable until the police caught me for stealing shoes). I didn't have any blistering or hotspots, and there aren't any sore spots on the bottom of my feet after.

There was one issue I found with these shoes. When running today with the Omni 13s the air temperature was 85 F, while last week when running with my worn out Puma Vectanas the air temperature was in the 60s. So, I have to give only 4.5 stars to these shoes. Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't support half stars, so it rounds up to five stars.

Update: I'm removing another half star (now a solid 4). I've found that when wearing these shoes NOT running, that there are some surfaces they seem to be incapable of squeaking on. They've had miles of break-in, yet they still squeak on the floor at work. It does not get any better. On the upside, it's only this floor that I've had it squeak on. Other floors of similar materials are quiet.

While I'm updating, in continued runs in the shoes, they have done wonderfully. I can't say the same for my socks.",Is this a shoe?,4.0,B0002M14II

"Short term reviews for this shoe are great and it's easy to understand why. The grip, comfort, and ventilation are all excellent. After a short break-in the Cohesion 8 feel like slippers.

But these shoes just don't hold up.

The foam lining at the toe section is thin and tears easily. Once the foam goes the mesh is next. After a couple of weeks everyday wear there is a hole where the big toe is, then the mesh tears away around the smallest toe. The cloth lining at the heel follows shortly thereafter.

This was my work shoe. I am on my feet all day but I do not work in an environment where shoes are subject to much abrasion. The tears begin on the inside of the shoe. I lived with the holes in the shoes for a couple of months because my clothes don't need to look good. And they didn't fall apart completely like a cheap Walmart shoe would. But holes in less than a month? Disappointing.

If you have normal or high arches you'll need additional arch support. My feet are a bit flat and so are these shoes so I wasn't bothered. The width was as expected. I didn't find them to run particularly narrow in the 10.5 Wide size but your mileage may vary.","Great comfort, poor durability.",3.0,B0002M1366

"Background - I switched to Saucony after having the same issue with Merrel trail runners (which i went to after Adidas), so the issue here may be my setup. I have very high arches, so i have to swap the stock insoles with Superfeet Green or Orange replacements. My usage is for hiking with a medium weight pack, not trail running.

Now on the the review. These shoes are amazingly comfortable right out of the box, and require little to no break-in. My challenge is that they are basically disposable items for me. After approximately 90 days, i consistently wear holes into the heels which cause them to chew up my feet (heel) as soon as the holes form. This behavior is consistent with their last generation 4.0 shoe as well as this one. My last pair (my 3rd set) was purchased in November, and i will be replacing them in February. I have tried multiple different sock combinations, liner & sock combinations, and blister pads to combat this and not found a successful combination to stop this.

So in summary - I give the shoe 4ish+ stars for comfort and support, but 2ish stars for durability. I'm guessing that other reviewers that stick with the Saucony insole do not have this same issue based on their feedback. Based on the fact they are cheap, i will stick with them but sure wish there was a brand i could use that didn't have this problem.",Great shoes - for 90 days,3.0,B0002M14TM
"This shoe has everything I was looking for
1) Stiff sole. Easily twice as stiff as the average running shoe.  Can withstand pretty rough terrain, on par with a hiking shoe. Great support.
2) Cushy insoles.  Provide soft feel without mushiness.
3) Versatile.  The styling of the grey color is muted enough to wear the shoe for pretty much anything, anywhere.  The trend today seems to be garish colors and eye catching style.  These have are understated and utilitarian while still looking good. The yellow on the outsole is not actually as bright as pictured.
4) Air flow - The material lets your foot breath freely. I like the fact that there is no waterproof layer in this model. Personally I despise Gore-Tex as it seems to trap moisture to the point your feet are soaked anyway.
5) Roomy toe box and nice width. I usually seek out W, E or EE, so buying D width usually doesn't work out.  My somewhat wide feet had no problems fitting into the Xodus 5.0.

Cons? If you have narrow feet, like a more minimalist and/or a very light shoe, or more eye-catching styles, this may not be for you.","Understated, super versatility",5.0,B0002M14TM

"I've been swapping between Salomon and Saucony for my last few trail runs.  I was running with the fellraisers because I needed the aggressive traction/soles but they were just a little too tight across the toe box.

Feels like slippers, which is saying something on desert rocky terrain,  Day two was a 8 mile round trip hike up 3400' with - decent trail, but lots of washed out sections with loose rocks and treacherous footing [ascent and descent].  Felt GREAT!  Superior traction, extremely comfortable, and provided great confidence in each footstep during the hike and slight trail jog in parts.

One more thing. There are numerous people who have commented on it fitting two loosely and recommending going a size down. That might have helped here, but I would not take the risk.

"Use:AT thru hiking and occasional running.

Having owned nearly all Xodus models (except for the original) and some even twice I have to say this is the least durable and most frustrating one of them all.  These trail runners are designed to do big mileage at slower paces, thus the heavier weight and over designed outsoles treads vs other lighter/faster types of trail runners.  Unfortunately this model does not hold up to the standard set by previous models when it comes to durability.  The meager total mileage compared to the track record of previous models of the Xodus deserves the 2/5 star rating because a broken shoe needs replacement.

In all I would give the Xodus a 4.5/5 star rating as they are terrific for trail hiking and thru hiking.  However I highly recommend skipping this model and going for the 4s or newer 6s",Xodus is king of long distance hiking.... Just not this years model,2.0,B0002M14TM

I great all around shoes. I use them all day everyday though I purposely bought them for work. I needed a sturdy shoe to use for work. Trail runners tend to work best because they are much sturdier than conventional running shoes. I work in a work shop with cement floors and tend to go through shoes every few months because the cushioning on most shoes compresses making it equivalent to standing on the concrete with bare feet.

"The leather, soles and stitching all looked top-notch and I love the classic styling, but the shoes squeaked so embarrassingly that they were essentially unwearable; I finally had to return them.

There seem to be two sources of the squeaks: walking surface and foam innersole. Most surfaces are fine but the soles squeaked like crazy on the polished concrete at work no matter how carefully I tread.  I liked the shoes so much I simply stopped wearing them to work.  The big problem relates to the inner soles: there seem to be pockets that trap air.  If I step slowly, there is a sigh of air escaping. The harder and faster I step, the higher-pitched the squeak.

I wore socks and the shoes never got wet. The shoes were worn regularly for several weeks in hopes the problem would go away but it did not. The left shoe wass especially bad as you could push hard with your fingers and get the squeak. I never had this issue with the Sperrys I bought in the 1980s-90s so am unsure how widespread the issue is, though I have read similar complaints on various websites.

"I've been wearing these for 30+ years.  No more.  In spite of the claim of 'authentic original,' they aren't.  My left shoe developed an annoying whistle a day after I started wearing them.  Being a patient man, I decided to wait it out.  Both shoes now whistle.  It appears that they have put some cheap foam between the inner leather and the sole at the high-pressure points - that's what's whistling.  Sperry is obviously aware of this problem, as they've tried to mitigate it by cutting 'vents' in the inner leather.  I'm still trying to figure out how 'original' shoes have this annoying modification.  On the bright side, blind people don't step out in front of me.

Update:
I still don't suggest buying these, but if you have a pair with the 'audio' feature:
I managed to silence mine by temporarily removing the insole and perforating the leather in the floor of the shoe.  The fundamental problem (with mine) is a poorly vented foam region in the 'ball of the foot' part of the insole.  A couple of short (3/8"") slices just toe-ward of the insole and I have blessed silence.  YMMV.",NOT 'Original',1.0,B0002LY3CS

"These shoes felt broken in from the get-go. They run large; even with a pair of insoles, I wear them with medium-weight socks, as anything thinner would mean my feet have too much freedom inside the shoes. The interior is synthetic, but it does a fine job at wicking away moisture.

The rubber soles wear well, though I've been using taps to extend their life. Initially the leather uppers looked good, but with time they have become less attractive (I've had the shoes for a year). High-quality leather uppers improve with age and generally develop fine, delicate creases with use. These leather uppers, on the other hand, have developed coarse, unsightly creases; they look like crinkled vinyl. For the record, I use shoe trees in these shoes. On the plus side, the shoes are adept at repelling water. When wet, the leather appears rough, but once dry it turns back to normal.

In short, these are fine for occasional use or for a brisk walk in the rain. They'll serve you well for a while, but don't expect too much.",OK FOR THE PRICE,3.0,B0002M6MIU

All the stitching has held and they show no signs of coming apart as I have become accustomed to with my shoes. And since they do hold up so well, the leather just looks and feels better and better as time passes.

"The boots look nice (a little artificial though.)  I wore them for the first time yesterday to church.  I put shoe inserts in them, because they were too big.  The inserts are double thick, so then the boots were kind of tight.  Perhaps regular inserts would work better.  Overall, I like the boots, but I am concerned that the ""printed design"" will scratch too easily.  Also, there is no groove in the bottom for the stitching.  I see the stiches wearing out too soon, if I wear them much.  Finally, I don't get why, if they were going to make the vamp and front of the shaft out of leather, they didn't just make the back of the shaft leather too?

Even if you had calves like Schwarzenegger they would be too big. I tried wearing them with straight leg pants (not jeans) and they bulge out making the leg look disproportionate.

"I have owned these boots since September of 2016 and worn them sparingly over that time. While the soles are barely worn, the leather (?) material in these boots has begun to crack, peal, and fall apart anywhere the boot flexes leading me to believe that his isn't even real leather as they have advertised.

Over the years Justin Boots have been synonymous with quality and value, but these boots fall well below expectations. Before writing this review, I reached out to Justin explaining the situation and allowing them to remedy it under their warranty.  The warranty posted on their website clearly states that ""Justin Brands, Inc. warrants our boots to be free from defects in workmanship and material."" These boots clearly have defective material but I was told by Justin that despite no mention of a one year limit on the warranty posted on their website, they would not honor the warranty because I had owned the boots for two months longer than a year.

I am done with Justin, and if you are looking for costume quality boots these fit the bill. If you plan on actually using your boots for any amount of time don't waste your time or money.

"The punchline of my review is that I've re-ordered this exact shoe three times, and each time a pair wears down (which I speed along by dancing 2-4 nights a week), I know it's still exactly what I want. The shoe is pretty simple but has what I want in a dance shoe: the suede bottom gives you the right balance of sliding and grip (as long as you keep it clean - a brush is helpful), the arch feels totally natural, and the 1-inch solid-wood heel allows me to make an uproarious stomp when I wear it to a folk dance.

The rounded look of the toes won't seem as sharp as a latin shoe, and the laces have a tendency to come undone if you don't double-knot them, but otherwise the shoe is excellent. Make sure to order a half or full size down from your street shoes, because you don't want any give when you're dancing - you want it to perfectly adhere to your foot and be there when you need it.",Third Pair,5.0,B0002UVL42

In addition, we purchased Bloch men's shoes to compare and ended up going with the Bloch because the Capezios were not as well made.

 Also, the Blochs felt better, were closer to being the right size (we still had to go up a half size in the Blochs), and were of a significantly higher quality leather for the same price.

"I ordered the size based on a pair of Capezio dance shoes I purchased from local store in Sacramento, CA.  The Amazon purchase was too small.  I had to pay for the return costs and even though the size still showed orderable on Amazon, the shoes were not available.  On the same day I made the above Amazon purchase, I purchased another pair of dance shoes, also from Amazon.  Experienced the same size problem.  They did have the required size.  I had to pay return costs to them as well and if there had not been a pair to exchange I would have had to pay a 15% restocking fee!  So in sum I had to make a trip to the post office, paid 25% additional in postage to return 2 pairs of shoes and ended up with 1 pair of shoes.

Even at a local store, where they have a device to measure the foot sizes, it is not uncommon for the salesman to make 2-3 trips to find a pair that fits.  Based on my experience it doesn't seem practical to order shoes this way.

He said these boots were very comfortable and even wore them to a wedding with his grey suit. He received a lot of compliments. This is a very good looking pair of boots.  I tried to purchase a much more expensive Italian boot for him last year, and the experience was a dismal disappointment. I am thrilled with the Dan Post Company and Amazon.

"I first bought these boots around August 1995, I had them until June 2007. I discard them not because they were worn out or broken, but because I separated from the US ARMY. I loved every minute I used them, they were very comfortable, plus I always got great comments and they looked great with my formal uniform, but of course I know how to do a great ""spit shine"" .

Disclaimer - I was an Enlisted Surgical Assistant that worked in the hospital all day and I had to change into scrubs with tennis shoes. The amount of wear I gave the boots it would be the same as someone that would use them all day in normal work settings for about 5 years.

These boot are NOT meant to be used in rough settings like camping or any outdoor activity, like a field unit or hiking. These boot are meant for light work, like in an office or for military special functions like parades.

I would not recommend them for cold weather (32F or less), the mesh on the side will let the cold right in.

I DO NOT recommend these boots for non-military personnel NOR for military personnel that never had to do a ""spit shine"" before. You know, those military guys that wear the tan boots from the moment they joined because it's too much work to ""spit shine"". Like my son and his buddies .

"This may be a little long so let me start with the conclusion, a great pair of boots. These boots lead one to believe they are for army, police and the like, which I am sure they would serve well for. My day to day is a little different. I work in a supermarket. I stand, walk, move, lift and generally never sit down for 8 hours a day six days a week. Before these boots I tried many others and never even consider a different pair now. They are comfortable supportive and last a long time. Again to my day to day, my feet get wet pretty often. Previous to these boots getting wet would cause my leather topped boots to crack from the wet dry cycle. These boots have a nylon top area that is great. It will take a shine when you wax the leather. And has never cracked split or torn. The sole is high quality softer than a vibram sole. In about 15 years I have been through 6 pairs, and when they are not good enough for work the are great for shovel work.

"Expensive, but easily the most comfortable boots I've ever owned. $184 is a huge chunk of change for me to drop and I feel like every penny was well spent. I would buy these boots again in a heartbeat. Fit true to size, and comfortable out of the box. There's no true break in period, but expect them to pinch your ankles for the first week of work. That can be aliviated by loosening the laces, though, and goes away quickly. Shines up like no other too, 10/10 great great boots, and sexy too.

Five month followup: After wearing these for work almost daily they're still holding up without issue. They've broken in and are even more comfortable than before. Even after five months of nightly foot patrols the soles show very little wear and the toe caps still shine up like they were new. 11/10. Fantastic boot and worth the cost, you're paying for quality.

"Woa, when someone said they are comfy right outta the box they sure weren't kidding.  I am a female cop and LOVE the look of paratrooper boots. So much so that normally the 1st weeks of wearing a new pair I am literally limping around in pain until they break in.  Yeah, stubborn,  but I love the style.  I decided I needed a little bit of a change so ordered these because of the contrast in material, they looked pretty cool but still my beloved jump boot look.  Due to reviews saying they run big, I got a size 6 (I am an 8 in women's and usually a 6.5 in men's).  I usually order 9 ' s in women's boots to accommodate inserts and thick socks in winter.  These fit perfectly for me, snug but just enough wiggle room if I need it.  I honestly can't get over how comfy they are--I work 12 hr shifts and start to finish have them on about 14 hours at a time.  Granted, I am driving more than walking, but dang they feel good on my feet. More comfy then my Nikes that's for sure.

Btw, this is my 3rd pair of Corcorans--the first two were the basic 10 inch women's jump boot, one had a side zipper and one were full lace.  The buttons broke on the side zip ones pretty early and they wore pretty quickly and just didn't look great after awhile.  And they were NOT particularly comfy.  Before those I work the Rocky jump boot. It wasn't a bad boot but the Corcorans have a much leaner look while the Rocky's looked so thick.

Buy these and you won't regret it!!",Love them!!!! (female),5.0,B0002ZYV7G
"I was very tentative about purchasing these.  Corcoran was purchased by another company since the last pair of their boots I've owned, and I noticed these don't have the vibram soles my Corcoran field boots had (those are excellent boots).

I have some of those tactical boots that use cordura, but wasn't sure how that would work on this classic design.  Plus these are about 40-50% more expensive than typical 'police' boots, and heavier and less sneaker like.  I've worn many jump boots, and spent years wearing the original design (and still wear some).  Those take a while to break in, have poor traction, and look amazing with excellent support.

These are definitely not really jump boots, but I like them a lot.  They cordura means there is essentially no break in time, but you really need to make sure you get the right boots, particularly with respect to width.  If they fit, they will feel awesome from the first second you put them on.  They do provide some ankle support and toe protection.  They shine easily once you remove the gunk they are shipped with.  BTW I have always stripped my boots before shining the first time, but with these the stuff that was on them was thicker and a bit greasier than any boot had before.  Plan to spend some time cleaning them up first.  But once that was done, Kiwi and water was enough to make them nearly like mirrors.  Against the fabric body of the boot, the cap and heel look amazing.

They aren't running shoes by any stretch of the imagination, and I don't think they are appropriate for those who get into foot pursuits, but they are otherwise really some of the best boots I've ever had, and seem to be very durable.  The sole is replaceable, so eventually I'll get those vibrams on them just in case I need to scale Mt Everest.",Worth the high price,5.0,B0002ZYV7G
"These shoes have a slight issue with taking them off.  The laces should be longer I had to skip a few holes at the top of the boot in order.  The laces to short so when I take them off it have to unlace them rather than loose the laces having slack.

I do like these boots better than my other boots because the heel of the boot doesn't slip which is a problem with leather boots.  It has a material that doesn't stretch so you must buy the boot the correct size.  The laces are the only way to get your boot good fitting or get your boot off period.  The weight of the boot as some complained is not bad as some here are really complaining about these boots that have respectively average weight.  Of course they will be heavier than tennis shoes or low cut boots they are ten inch high with hard soles.  I like the speed lace holes and hard soles protect my feet.  Yeah these boots look like they would protect you from water although I haven't tested.",Good almost perfect,4.0,B0002ZYV7G

"I'm editing my review after wearing these every day for work for 6 months. I still really like them, however I have a couple complaints. One, the fabric coating on the insole has come detached from the rubber and fallen out, leaving a sticky rubber bottom, which is really disappointing. Second, the rubber material of the sole is a bit soft and has worn down on the heel where it strikes the ground, losing a good quarter inch.
Otherwise, I still really like them.

Finally wore out my Corcoran jump boots after 8 years (sole started to detatch) and decided I wanted something more breathable for humid weather. After trying several styles of boots, including jungle boots, I found that these work really well and are very comfortable. They run true to size and are not too narrow. Like all boots they need to break in, but were still pretty comfy out of the box. speed laces work well. Good construction. Heel is a little tall for my taste,  but I prefer minimalist, zero drop footwear.

I bought these Nike sandals because unfortunately after 25 years my old Nike Geta Sandals finally wore out.  That being said those old sandals were purchased before there was an internet and doing online reviews was only science fiction ;)  Those original sandals were so comfortable and they lasted a very long time.  So I did a web search to see if I could find another pair of the same make and found these.  They are almost exactly the same design as my 25 year old model.  At the moment I have been wearing the new ones for about a month and they are starting to break in.  The length that I ordered originally was a 12 because I normally wear a 11.5 or a 12 shoe.  The 12 was too long so I sent them back and ordered the 11.  The 11 is the perfect length but the width is kind of tight.  But now after wearing them for a month they are starting to stretch out and I think they will be just fine.,) Those original sandals were so comfortable and they lasted a very long time,3.0,B00031U8U8

"These 10"" high winter boots set the standard for basic cold weather boots in snowy conditions. They're probably the boot most commonly worn by locals in snowy Western mountain towns.

But be advised they do not have a lot of lateral stability in the sole of the boot. That is to say, the rubber bottoms tend to twist sideways making them, in my opinion, unsuitable for anything other around town use and possibly some work situations. The twisting motion makes traveling off beaten paths, especially climbing hills or side hilling, more difficult and tiring. My seven year old (Canadian made) Sorel Caribou models have somewhat thicker and probably more water resistant leather uppers, but the current (Chinese made) Sorels seem to have more advanced combination synthetic and wool felt liners and apparently much-needed additional underfoot insulation.

These boots have a cool look with the faux shearling collars but their relatively modest height means you will need to wear gaiters to keep out snow if you leave beaten paths. Felt lined pacs are typically the warmest boots for the bucks and the liners can be taken out to dry. I've washed my Sorel liners on gentle cycle using wool-friendly soap with excellent results and spraying some Armorall (used to perk up rubber and plastic in cars) on the rubber bottoms keeps them looking great as well.

Recommended to anyone who wants a warm, foolproof, traditional looking boot to wear in around-town or to cold weather outdoor events, keep in the car for emergencies and possibly wear to work or riding snow machines in really cold weather.",Probably your best choice for a warm basic snow boot,4.0,B00068CXGU

Excellent shoes. I have a brown pair and I just bought them in black. I loved this shoes. They are very comfortable and very stylist.,Santa Barbara Cole Haan Shoes,5.0,B0006M1VXW
"If you're anything like me, then this shoe is for you.  I have a mid-wide flat foot, and often struggle to find comfortable shoes I can wear in a formal setting.  From an active shoe perspective, I have had above average to excellent experience in comfort and performance of cross-trainers built with Nike Air technology.

When I discovered Cole Haan through online research, a brand that isn't sold in my country, I jumped at the opportunity because of the Nike Air technology embedded in this formal shoe.  I took a chance and was pleasantly surprised.

Even more than six months later, they are now worn in, still as comfortable as the day I put them on, and feel more like I am walking on air as compared to an active shoe.

I find my feet ordinarily have struggled to breathe trapping unnecessary moisture in many other shoes, but these Cole Haan's have really been designed well for comfortability and breathability - I feel like I am walking tall and dry.  They are also quite light, yet anchored with ample heel support.  A gold star has to go to the arch support as this is not over-powering, an area I often struggle with because of my flat foot.

I chose the black polished version, because of the finished look.  I was concerned that I'd struggle to maintain the finish, but it has been all that difficult.  A simple polish and shine routine, and a leather oil once a week seems to do the trick.  I am really very happy with this product, just sad because it took me years to find it.

I hope this pair of shoes gives you at least the same level of comfort I've received.","I took a chance, and was pleasantly surprised",5.0,B0006M1VXW

"Out of the box, the shoes were tight around the outer toe. So tight that I took them off periodically throughout the first day because they actually hurt. By the time I got home from work I was carrying them. I wore different shoes on day 2, and then gave these a try again on day 3 because sometimes you just have to break shoes in. They weren't as bad, but still snug. I was happy to take my shoes off at the end of the day and my toes were sore for nearly a day later, but I was never in pain on day 3. This week I gave them another go. They're still snug around the toes and the shoe kind of bulges where my little toe is, but they no longer hurt. Maybe they will continue to break in further and I'll grow to like the shoes better, but I've never really had this kind of problem with shoes. I'll keep wearing them for the time being because they are new and look nice (and no longer hurt), but I'll not order this version of Cole Haans next time.",Tight in the toes,3.0,B0006M1VXW

"I was looking for some leather flip flops and purchased these ones on sale at half price ($25), so whether or not they were great wasn't a big deal to me... but really, they're Columbia, so they're bound to be pretty good.

The sandals arrived and I was first struck by the traction on the outsole of the sandals, which reminded me much more of serious hiking boots than sandals. The sandals are very comfortable, with a padded leather strap and generous arch support. I was a bit concerned about the color when I ordered them, but if you're concerned this color will be too light, don't worry--they darken up within a few weeks.

I have used them almost daily for a month now and have almost no complaints... of course, there's no perfect product. My one complaint is that the insoles, being dark, tend to emphasize whatever might land on them... that sounds evasive, I know, but I'm not sure what it is. Just little white bits of whatever your feet encounter while walking. This is hardly Columbia's fault, however, and one would encounter this on any similar product. The little white bits of... whatever... are easily brushed away, of course, but they just have more of a tendency to stick in the soft leather as compared to, say, synthetic sandals. This issue is so minor when put up against the sandals as a whole, however, that it is nearly unnoticeable.

I look forward to these rugged and durable sandals lasting me for years to come.",Very comfortable sandals with great arch support,5.0,B0006PQH1A

As it is it fits just about what how I'd expect a normal size to. The detailing with the leather arch region and the sewing is a bit weird - although I've gotten use to it I caution anyone who is touchy about having ""seams"" or other things on their feet to know that it's got that going on. So far I've worn them around my apartment, out to run errands, and on long commutes to/walking around campus in the Bay Area from Sacramento.

I only got rid of the other ones because I wore them to the beach too many times and they just got horribly dirty and worn, but 3-4 years later, I could have just scrubbed them down good and they would have still been fine. The material that the sole is made from is SOLID. I don't know if they even really wore down at all before I stopped wearing my first pair.

"Good arch support and the air works very well for chushioning. The fingertrap design allows the shoe to be worn like a slip on (if desired) as the tongue of the shoe is actually attached. It can be tightened as much as the wearer desires (which has been great for an injury that I had that required ""extra"" compression.) The only issue I have with these shoes, and the reason I didn't rate them at 5 stars, is the mesh that is the breathable layer against the sock, gets dirty very easily and not easy to clean with a rag. They can be machine washed but I was not trying to wash my shoes every couple of days.  (I know, then why did I buy a white shoe?)

Unfortunately after less than 60 days of use, and minimal wear, the sandals are already falling apart.

I noticed this as soon as I took them out of the box but figured it would not be an issue...sadly I was wrong.

"These shoes are wonderful. I bought these for my son, and he loves them. They are a very versatile shoe. My son wears them mainly for dress, but wears them occasionally with his khakis.

Bostonian is a very reputable brand, since these are Italian made there is a higher quality of workmanship into these shoes. Most shoes are made in India, China, Vietnam, or Taiwan.

"My first pair of Portland Oxfords I bought because I liked the write-up: a more-than-usually comfortable shoe, with toe and heel padding, which nonetheless looked good enough to wear on all but the most formal of occasions.

That first pair lived up to and exceeded my expectations. I walk a lot as part of my conditioning program (read: diet). So I wanted shoes that I could wear both for walking the track and for daily wear through teaching and walking about campus. These fit that description.

The first pair is still marching along. They are brown; heading for Europe this summer, I decided that one more pair--black--would give me total shoe coverage. The new pair arrived last week; after an initial breaking in (about 6 miles, then a one-hour track walk), they were as comfortable as the first pair.

Both pairs of shoes met, even exceeded, my expectations. I'll be buying these into the foreseeable future. I add: the size is what I expected from its label; I wanted 11m, and got a shoe that fit.

"Husband wears a size 14 so finding shoes for him is no easy feat. We bought these, Rockport Fisherman, and Teva, and these were the best, hands down. These are all leather and there's enough room to insert orthotics if needed. The Rockports were not leather and the Teva were too small. Interestingly, both the Rockports and the Teva's squeeked when he walked around the house in them (not a good thing in a shoe) so both were returned. Rockports were about $10 less and the Teva's were about $20 less. These are worth the price, especially if you have trouble finding larger sizes.

"The Clarks Men's Hudson Sandal is almost perfect. The insole is well padded and supportive as well as correctly shaped to my feet. I have worn these sandals on many long walks including hikes in the woods. My only problem concerns the strap which extends over the top of the wearer's foot. This strap did not secure completely when it  was pulled tight because it did not have enough velcro type material to make complete contact.  I had a shoe repair shop correct this problem by sewing additional velcro on that strap. I expect a wearer with a very high instep would not require this repair. With this minor inexpensive repair, these really are perfect sandals.",almost perfect,4.0,B0007MFVAA

"My wife purchased this replacement pair in August so I could get rid of my 2 year old pair.  She gave them to me yesterday for our anniversary.

Imagine my surprise this morning, after wearing them yesterday for the first time, when the leather loop holding the buckle for the top cross support strap just ripped open.  Now the buckle won't hold the strap and the sandal is basically worthless.  Checked on line and the return deadline was Sept. 11th.  No way to complain or tell someone they might have a problem other than this rating box.  My old pair of Clarks sandals lasted 2 years and I wear them a lot.  This pair did not last 8 hours after they came out of the box yesterday.  The stickers are still on the soles!  I am NOT HAPPY at all.  In looking at the leather loop holding the buckle and comparing it to my old pair, the new one has a leather ""loop"" about as thick as a piece of paper.  Not my old pair.  The leather is much thicker and stronger.
AVOID!

UPDATE 12/23/15 (I'm a little late):  contacted the manufacturer and they sent me a replacement pair at no charge.  This was probably 2 weeks after my experience & post.  I advised the rep of the problem, fired off a couple pics for him showing details and all is fine now.",Did NOT last 8 hours and I'm stuck with them.,1.0,B0007MFVAA

This Hudson sandal is AWFUL.  Materials are cheap and hard, looks are so so, but it is impossible to adjust the side straps in such a way that they don't press hard into your insoles, it's the stupidest design I've ever seen.  I even upped the size to see if I could let the strap out enough to give my insole a little relief, no go.  The price is still right, looks are OK, I kept walking around in them hoping to like them.  I did not.  They are going back.  And I cannot find an alternative, anything even CLOSE to the BioFix 2 in terms of looks, comfort, pricing and availability, anywhere, including Amazon. Tried a lot of options, nothing compares to the BioFix 2.  CLARK'S, BRING THEM BACK! I've basically put my sandal shopping on hold until spring and hoping that either Clark's brings back the BioFix 2, or someone else offers something close.

"Purchased these in October of 2014 and I'm ready to throw them out. While they are comfortable in general, I have two issues. The outer sole or tread if you will is not durable and is wearing out. The biggest problem is the foot bed is covered with some material that does not appear to be leather. It attracts dirt and leaves which stick to the stuff requiring me to take the sandals off and scrape the debris out. On true leather sandals debris such as small twigs, stones and bits of leaf will just fall out. Recently I've noticed the fake leather material is lifting away from the foot bed, becoming loose and clumping.

"I've enjojed several pairs of store-bought Clark's sandals over the years but unfortunately it seems they got carried away with cost cutting... Earlier this year the only models I could find did not have rear strap adjustment and did not fit well. For me size 11 is too small, but in a size 12 without rear strap adjustment my heel goes all the way back whereby the larger space in front of my toes creates a catch-point for tripping going up on steps... (To reduce this would require over-tightening the front strap and that can cut-off blood circulation).

Those sandals have the exact same length as my new Hudsons but with the Hudson's rear strap adjustment I can optimize the fit. They also look more classy and elegant.

"Clarks Desert Boot is a must have boot & all should own at least 1 pair, in my opinion. They never go out of style & are versatile enough to be worn for many occasions. I have been wearing another pair, in the taupe brushed/distressed suede, for 7 years & they are still a good boot I will continue to wear. Despite what some may assume or say, the crepe sole last a long time & are more durable than you would expect. They are extremely comfortable, especially after you break in. Ive wanted the Beeswax Desert Boot for a while ,so finally ordered & received them. The shipping was slow , even for free shipping, but well worth the wait. They have a very nice & unique finish, quality leather & have a somewhat worn or distressed look after wearing them just the first time. You have to expect that look with the type of leather the beeswax Desert Boot has & is part of the appeal of them. These seem to require a little more time to break in compared to the suede, but expected w/ a firmer leather.  The light crepe sole will get dirty immediately but it doesnt look bad or noticeable to anyone. I did have a little concern bc every pair Ive owned had Clarks Originals Desert Boot printed on the insole. These just have Clarks  in plain black lettering. A few other buyers confirmed that theirs had the same Clarks lettering so that put me at ease. They are authentic so no concerns there. As others say, order 1/2 to a full size smaller than you wear in other shoes. I normally wear an 11.5 & have to go with 10.5 with Clarks. I love the beeswax finish & will enjoy them for years to come. I didn't give 5 stars bc the seller did not address my concern & if I could just rate them, I would give less stars but I don't want their lack of customer service to reflect on Clarks or the Desert Boot.

"I've been wearing the cheaper version of these boots for a few years now. The Bushacres are similar, but thought the only difference was the sole. I was wrong.

The desert boot comes with a more supple and better top leather than the bushacres, meaning they feel more comfortable off the bat, and mold more to my flipper like thin feet as they wear in. I have always gotten new pairs of bushacres because the sole begins to hurt my feet and they get way less comfortable after about 6mos. to a year of continuous wear (these are my work shoes for my job). But, the crepe sole is so comfortable that I think they will last way longer and just wear in even better than any other boot I have worn.

I will definitely continue to wear these boots for several more years.","Between the bushacre version and the desert boot, the price difference is worth it.",5.0,B0007MFW8Q

"I just bought a pair of these shoes from Amazon - 10.5 Medium Width - after trying on a 10.5 in my local shoestore. The 10.5 from Amazon was larger than the 10.5 in my local Clark's store; however it was the same shoe in design and form. It also had the same manufacture and origin markings, and same ""feel"" to the leather. Since the fit was a bit large, I ordered a 10 to see how that shoe fits and am giving away as a gift the 10.5's. I have yet to receive the 10's from Amazon, and will post an update when I do.
The shoe feels comfortable, but I can almost ""swim"" in the toe box compared to most other shoes. There is a lot of room. In fact the 10.5's in the local shop had about 3/8"" inch from the toe to the end of the shoe - the 10.5's from Amazon had about 3/4"" from the end of my toe to the tip of the shoe.
If the 10's from Amazon don't work out I'll probably pay the sizeable price premium and buy the shoes locally. The local shoes felt better on my foot for some odd reason.
Don't get me wrong, it's a nice shoe - it's just that typically I am a 10.5 and this shoe really didn't feel true-to-size while the shoe at my local store did.
So my advice is try the shoe based on how it fits, not necessarily on the sizing indicated on the box or in the shoe.

UPDATE:
The 10's from Amazon arrived, and they fit perfectly. They fit snugly with no slippage and just enough wiggle-room. I am very pleased and eager to put some wear on these shoes and report back on how they perform over the mid-to-long term. With regard to sizing, I believe that if you have a size 10-10.5 foot, go with the 10's. If you're between 10.5 and 11, use the size 10.5 shoe.",Good shoe,4.0,B0007MFRGI
"I've been wearing Clarks Natureveldt shoes for at least 7 years now and have gone through about 4 pairs during that time.

Previous pairs had been made in Europe, however, the two pairs (one black and one brown leather) that I recently purchased were made in China. So far, the fit is the same between the Chinese manufactured shoes and the European made ones. There are however some design differences, of which the tongue is the most apparent as it appears to be made a little bit cheaper than previously. The laces also appear to be a bit cheaper.

Should note though that overall the design/build of the shoe appears to be about the same or better in most areas. Time will tell however, as these shoes are pretty much legendary for lasting a long time.

The main thing that I've always liked about these shoes is how comfortable they are even from the first wear. They do not require any break-in whatsoever due to the type of leather used, how they are constructed and how they fit on your foot.

They just feel good on my feet. They are also pretty comfortable to walk in and since I have flat feet, this is a must have in a shoe for me.

I personally like the style of the shoe, although some might find them to be a bit too classic, laid back or casual for a leather shoe.

All in all, these are the only leather shoes that I really feel good about buying these days, however that might change if the move to China significantly decreases the useful life of the shoe.",Comfortable shoes out of the box,4.0,B0007MFRGI

The natural leather was equal to my previous pairs. (Most leather shoes have artifical leather ""skins"" added in processing for a uniform appearance. Only Natureveldts have the original cow hide finish so they vary from each pair to the next. Breathability) The only difference I could spot was a 20% thinner polyurethane sole section.

"I love these shoes and they look good with everything from khakis to jeans.  Since they're a lighter color, I did buy some scotchguard spray to treat them and it seems to help keep the water and dirt at bay.  I'm not opposed to the worn in look but if I can prolong it, so be it.

The one thing I want to mention is that these do run big, both in feel and actual fit...more on that in an minute.  I'm an 8 1/2 in every type of shoe and sneaker so I ordered an eight and a half in these and had to return them for a bigger size.

With that being said, if you've never worn a boot style shoe (i hadn't either), it feels a little foreign at first and finding what you think is the right size/fit is challenging.  While the sole and arch of the shoe cinch down, the top of the boot is, by design, not snug against your ankles to allow your ankle to flex without excessive rubbing.  This movement, however, makes it tough to know if the whole shoe is too big or if you're just not used to having the top of your footwear feel loose.  It's a little difficult to explain.  Anyway, at first, I thought that the 8 1/2 (my normal size)  WAS the right size and the design of the shoe was what made it FEEL big. With the free returns and prime free shipping,  I just ordered the 8 and held on to the 8 1/2 to do a comparison fit.  Needless to say, the 1/2 size smaller than what I usually wear was the right size.  The ankle still kind of floats around, again, by design, but the sole and arch areas are a much better fit.  So, go with a half size smaller.",One of the most comfortable pairs of shoes I've owned but run about 1/2 size big.,5.0,B0007MG0TQ

That being said, this is probably the 6th or 7th pair of Wallabees I've purchased, so I ordered accordingly (I wear a 9.5 in Allen Edmonds/Alden's/Sperry and order 8.5 for Clark's).  The sand suedes will arrive and feel snug-to-tight out of the box.  They quickly break in and the suede will relax - this is why it is important to go a size smaller.  I usually throw on a pair of thicker socks and wear them around the apartment the first day or two; wear them on short errands around the neighborhood.

"I wear Sz. 9 in most shoes/sneaks; and as the Wallabees used to run large, I had purchased the 8.5 Wallabee (Maple Tan Suede) 2 years ago, and they fit great...enough room to replace the existing cushioned insole with a thick orthotic in one shoe with room to spare.  So I ordered another sz 8.5D this time in brown suede, but they've changed significantly.  First, the sizing is quite different.  An 8.5 was too snug even w/o the orthotic.  Second, Clarks no longer uses the cushioned / removable footbed.. just a small and thin 1/2  sole covering just the rear half of the otherwise flat insole. So the shoes are immediately less ""cushy"", really have no arch support;  though if you buy your normal size there may be just enough room to add an aftermarket insole..  A few other noticeable differences: a taller/stiffer heel counter (which may be good or not),  stitching is coarser then before, etc.
  I returned the size 8.5 ; and tried on a size 9 elsewhere...it probably would work but is still less roomy than the 8.5 from a year or two ago.  SO...whatever you've read about these running large...that's no longer true.  I'm personally disappointed in general about the somewhat lowered quality in this boot, which used to be my favorite, and which is not inexpensive; but to a 1st-time buyer, that might not matter.","Ok, but not as good as they used to be.",3.0,B0007MG0K0

Anyone who would claim these boots can't handle whatever you want to throw at them probably doesn't care for their boots properly. I'd strongly advise you to rub a generous layer of mink-oil into them ($3 walmart), let it sit for 24 hrs, and then accept that your only ever going to take your feet out of them if there is a mountain in your way that needs climbing.

"One of the shoes I received had a defect with the inside cushion for the sole of the foot.  The cushion was too large and therefore lumped up in the shoe and could not be flattened out since it was too large.  Also the shoes arrived in a box that was scratched up and appeared not to be new and there was a slight scuff mark on the side of the shoe.  I've worn these same Bostonian shoes for years without a problem, but as I've seen in the reviews, there are now complaints on quality and these shoes are now made in India rather than in Italy (I checked a previous pair with these and found that to be true).  That is my experience as well.  Since I didn't even wear them Amazon processed a return.  But I have to spend the time returning them and I am very disappointed that someone is not watching the quality of what is sold here.  And now I don't know if I will order this brand again.

"These shoes are terrible. They should not have the Bostonian label, especially not the 'Strada'. I still have a black pair of Stradas that I bought about 8 years ago. They still fit comfortably and are in good condition. These, on the other hand, I predict won't last past a year.

I wish I had heeded the past reviews. I had another pair of brown Bostonians that were of a lower quality than my old black Stradas, but this pair of shoes is an extreme shift in the quality of Bostonian shoes. The leather looks fake and the fit has the typical characteristics of a low-wage mass production article. The rise of the right shoe is slightly too high, so it digs into my ankle. The first couple of times I wore the shoes I got bruises on my feet. The leather has stretched, but these shoes are still uncomfortable. The soles squeak on certain surfaces, making them annoying in a quiet office atmosphere. The only reason I don't return them is because I live overseas and I bought the shoes while visiting the US during the holidays.

"As some of the previous reviews have mentioned, now that the manufacturing moved from Italy, the shoe quality doesn't live up to the Bostonian name.  I have worn the Italian version 12W for many years and it finally started cracking across the ball of the foot.

Hoping that the previous reviews were exaggerating, I ordered a 12W of the current shoe.  When I tried it on, it was extremely tight (like an 11W), but the markings showed it was a 12W.  Additionally, the workmanship and materials were not up to the original Italian version.  It's now quite a Payless shoe, but it's not a Bostonian either.

The Italian version was worth $100.  I would have expected this one in the $20 range.  If you've worn the Italian version, don't bother with this one.  You won't be happy.",No longer the same quality,2.0,B0007MG59Q

Not the same shoe at all.  Does not seem to be the same quality leather.  Heel comes up quite a bit further and digs into the back of my heel.

"My dad, at 88 y/o is an old farmer at heart and about as tight as they come, especially in things such as shoes for himself. He has had few new pairs in his life. I just bought these shoes for him convincing him that he should have a few things he simply wanted, instead of what he desperately had to have. All he could see was the $86 price tag that about cost him his eye teeth. He has had two pairs of these Bostonian Stradas--one he got at a yard sale for $4, the other at a thrift shop for $5. After many years (~20?)he has finally worn both pairs out. These shoes came yesterday. He put them on & started talking! He is still talking about them. He's said over and over that he has never had a new pair of shoes that were so comfortable, in fact as comfortable as the old pair he now wears out to garden. The toe box is roomy, the padded collars snug to his feet and the leather is so soft it won't need any breaking in. He has never had fine things, but he gladly paid the $86, and he might even pay more next time--but there won't be a next time. If they last as long as the first two pairs, he'll be but a plethora of fond memories in my life.","Kumfee, Yes, maam",5.0,B0007MG59Q

Some dress shoes can feel stiff and heavy. Not these - these feel comfortable and flexible. I never got blisters or anything, even on days when I've walked quite a bit.

"I've worn the Men's Bostonian Tuscana Oxford shoe style for about 5 years now.  I would agree with many of the reviews from 2005 to 2008.  These were the most comfortable dress/casual shoes I've worn.  Due to some medical issues, I needed a very comfortable shoe that provided comfort, support, good service life, and at a reasonable price.  When I found my first Bostonians at a local store it was the best fit ever.  I've had to order on line the last couple replacements due to closure of the local store.  However, this last order gave me a surprise.  Instead of receiving a good quality Italian made shoe with all the comfort I previously enjoyed, I received this cheaper version made in India - for about the same price.  These shoes no longer fit like a glove; the medium width is wider and the length is a shade longer.  And, I have to agree with one of the other reviewers; it just doesn't have the same quality feel of a good leather shoe.  If this is the quality Bostonian is going to, then I'll be looking for a new brand.  I bought based on previous product experience, next time I check the current reviews first.",Shoe Takes a Bad Turn,2.0,B0007MG59Q
"I have bought Bostonian shoes for years now and have always been a happy customer.  When I received these shoes I was surprised at how cheap they looked.  For the price, you would expect a nice classy leather upper.  Instead, these ""leather uppers"" appear to me as cheap vinyl made to look like leather.  I honestly don't believe they are leather.  Doesn't smell like it.  Doesn't feel like it.

Also, I ordered my normal size and the fit is way too big.  Not snug and comfortable but like the very cheap and very wide shoes you buy at Walmart from the no-brand shelf.  You can't pull the shoelaces tight enough to stop the shoe from moving around your foot when you walk.

"The overall boot quality is good with leather less dry than than Post's.  However, the right boot is larger than the left and both boots have significant heel slop.  Trying to buy replacement boots has been a learning lesson.  I began this search because Twist X Boot while fitting incredible well in both the ankle and heel and made out of superior leather are not available in 3E width.  Stretching the Twisted boots for width drastically shortens the leathers' life.  Post & Justin boots are made in Mexico and Twisted X in China.  I'm guessing that the latter will not entertain odd sizes due to potential translation/return issues.

"The boots are a bit more ""distressed"" than what I gathered from the description, but I slathered them with Bick 4 & buffed them out with a horsehair brush & they look great. A major western wear retailer listed these boots at $294, but I got them on Cyber Monday sale from Amazon for $131, so the price was too good to pass up. Being Justin's, they fit like a glove & are very comfortable. New boot break-in is usually a less than delightful experience, but the leather on these is very supple, so even wearing them all day at work has not been a problem; I'm sure the Bick 4 treatment helped, but the leather on these boots is very comfortable & pliable.","Great Boots, Great Price",5.0,B00024R8LS

"I love this shoe! I bought this shoe to take with me to Costa Rica for a month of exploration in the mountains.  The shoe fits snuggly and you don't need to worry about it falling off of your foot in the water.  This shoe drains quickly once it has been submersed in water.  It was nice to not have to wait for days for my shoes to dry out before I could use them again. It does take some time for the upper part of the shoe to dry out as it is cloth, but it's not a huge deal as they were dry the next morning.
I have really enjoyed the traction of this shoe as well. I was climbing on rocks that were wet and walking through water and then climbing on more rocks to get where I was going.  I had no problem getting traction, no matter how wet the bottom of the shoe was.
I really like that this shoe is so casual, it looks like a regular tennis shoe, but there's so much more to it! The added plus is that there is a great sole insert that provides great support for your body. I really liked being able to wear my hiking shoes with my shorts and not look like I was going hiking.
I highly recommend this shoe to anyone who does any type of hiking or boating.  I really enjoy the structure and stability this shoe has to offer.
If you are looking for a sizing guide for this shoe, you can go to [...] and find the shoe and then look at their sizing guide. They even have instructions for measuring to make sure you get a great fitting shoe.

"My wife and I will be taking a vacation later this summer, so I bought matching pairs of Nevados V6474M Kariba sandals in the closest sizes available.  Mine were way too small, her's were way too big, and we both agreed the appearance left a lot to be desired.  We also felt the open sides would let a lot of sticks and rocks in. So, we returned the Nevados and ordered the Columbia Outpost Hybrids.

We ordered our usual shoe size (5-1/2 and 10-1/2) and both pairs of the Outpost Hybrids fit perfectly.  We were also much happier with the running shoe appearance, than the sandals that look like some kind of weird space boots. The Outposts look ""normal"" enough to wear to the store after hiking, and also have much better traction.

Last weekend we had the opportunity to go hiking with them at the local park.  I was a little concerned about wearing the shoes without socks, but we were both very pleased with how comfortable they were to wear barefoot. We found the Outpost Hybrids to have excellent traction, both on loose gravel paths and climbing up steep rock trails. Just for fun, we went wading when we got down to the lake, and were quite happy with the performance of these shoes. The rocks, sticks, and other debris stayed out, but they drained quickly once we were out of the water. Perhaps just as important, they were still very comfortable to walk on dry trails with after being dunked in the lake. No squishy sounds, no rubbing, and no pruney feet when we took them off.

They were slightly damp when we got home, but still very comfortable. We did pull out the removable insoles when we got home and it took overnight for them to dry completely, but we certainly wouldn't hesitate to wear them in their slightly damp condition.

Overall, these are some of the best shoes we've ever purchased. They should work great for our trip this summer where we'll be hiking in rivers and across dry land. Just what we were looking for.

The only negative, they have a fairly strong plastic smell. My wife says they smell like bandaids. I assume that will go away over time.",Great Hiking Shoes,5.0,B0002528IU

I've run thousands of miles in them, but they're my walking shoes too, and if you need to stand for hours at a time they're great for that too. They're one of the few running shoes that come in different widths, and they offer the kind of support, stability, and cushioning podiatrists recommend for flat feet.  I use prescription orthotics and wear them under the insoles.  I've tried the more expensive 2001's with leather in place of suede, but the 991's seem to last longer and hold up better.

"I have wide feet (2E). It's very hard to find a wide soccer cleat. I visited several stores looking for something that fit comfortably, but everything was too narrow. At one point, I was going to settle for some UA cleats (which seemed wider than others), but they still were not very comfortable, and the synthetic material felt cheap.

Luckily, I found out about the Puma Kings. They fit true to size (I wear 10.5, and these fit perfectly lengthwise). They fit wider than all the others that I tried. They're snug, but not tight. Definitely comfortable. They're leather, and they have a nice classic look. I found a place locally that had them on clearance (not sure how that happened?), so they were only $64. But after the ordeal that I had finding something that fit, I'd pay $100.

"I really wanted to like these boots.  I bought them to replace my 20-plus year old Hodgman hip waders that I wore year in and year out fishing streams, rivers, lakes, etc, etc.  I expected to do the same with these.  Unfortunately, as it turns out the soles of these boots weren't up the task of trekking through brush, over trees/branches and through the forest along the river's edge.  At the start of season two I began to notice that my right sock was damp and sometimes a bit wet.  I chalked it up to a sweaty foot or maybe a little splash over the top of the boot, but as I continued to use the boots the dampness got worse.  I inspected the boot with no real luck of finding the hole.  I even went as far as tying off the top of the boot and adding compressed air to fill the boot up while I held it under water - still nothing.  Eventually, I narrowed it down to the shoe area and finally found some punctures in the mid-sole that would only open up as the sole was flexed.  So with every step a little bit of water was introduced to the boot.  I used Gorilla tape to stop the leak for one season, but eventually the other boot followed suite and ultimately the boot bodies started to crack and fail after season two.  Season three I wore them to pass through the trees and brush, but knew that if I set foot in the water my feet would get wet.

I can say they are comfortable, even more so than the Hodgmans I mentioned earlier; mostly because the ""rubber"" on the Pro Line boot is thinner and more malleable.",With every step a little bit of water was introduced,3.0,B0000E0C7M

"Onsite 5.11b/c and have pretty precise footwork.

Have not been using my Katanas in the gym, only outdoors on smoothish limestone.

My left tow did not blow out, but simply started peeling away at the tip... after ONLY ONE MONTH of frequent outdoor climbing. I had gotten a really good deal on these, and so decided to take the risk on the reputation I've seen for the toes to blow out. Should have listened. It doesn't affect my climbing, it's more of just a huge annoyance and mental distraction to see the toe basically start unfolding from the sole, little by little.

Such a major build flaw. I have the cheaper Tarantulas as well as the more expensive Miura VS. I only occasionally use the VS for projecting, but the Tarantulas, I ran them down big time over 2 years as my gym shoe, and they only recently started wearing down at the toe. Katanas are a great design and fit, but poor build quality at the tips. It seems that it just starts pulling away from the sole, and the rand is just too thin there at the area where it should be reinforced a bit.

Shouldn't affect your climbing if you are climbing at high/intermediate levels (your footwork should not be afffected; although you might be distracted as to not encourage it pulling away even more from the sole), but it's a major friggin' eyesore, mental distraction, and huge disappointment.

Plus, even with hours in the gym, I'm never wanting to take them off. Love how the lacing offers more flexibility and the leather stretches to fit. Great for smearing.

"If you want a steel toe cowboy boot that looks like a cowboy boot, this and a couple other options from Double H seem to be the sum total of your choices across the entire broad spectrum of boot manufacturers.

On the plus side, it looks like a cowboy boot should, and it has a good walking heel, and good tread.  The leather was very soft, and they were as comfortable as they could be immediately, with no miserable break-in period.  They were marked very prominently with Made in USA, and appear to be of fully domestic manufacture.

On the more neutral side, it's sad that we've reached the point where something affordable that's made in America is almost by definition going to be of inferior quality to something foreign.  It is what it is.  I've lost a couple of trucking jobs due to the imported stuff from China and Vietnam vastly surpassing American-made stuff with American people working in American factories for American wages with American environmental regulations trying to make a price-competitive product, and ultimately going out of business for their effort.  The days when foreign meant crappy are over, and the tables have, sadly, turned.  Made in America at a reasonable price point means made cheap, because Americans are expensive to pay, American society is litigious, American insurance is expensive, and the only way to cut costs is on materials and workmanship.  This is very apparent in these boots, which have a cheap, Made in Taiwan look about the low quality stitching and poor finish work.  In of itself, it's excusable, since they're boots meant for working that are going to get banged up and dirty, and at least you're helping to employ Americans.

On the negative side, I decided to wear these boots to work after trying them on and walking around in them for awhile.  They were not immediately uncomfortable, but after putting in a 12 hour shift I would have been willing to use a Dremel tool to cut the wretched things off my feet at the end of the day if I hadn't been able to pull them off.  I wear an 11 EE in pretty well everything, but 11 EE in these boots is MUCH too narrow for my toes.  The steel toe cap is the entire problem, and were it not for that, I'm sure they would stretch out just enough to accommodate my feet.

Since there is no stretching steel, the only choice is to go with a bigger size, but as they fit perfectly in every other respect, I would expect a larger size to be unacceptably loose in a pull-on boot.  I would try an 11 EEE if I wanted to gamble another $150, but I don't feel that lucky.  My daydreams of wearing a true high-heel western style boot to work are obliterated, and I will be buying something entirely different and much uglier in the interest of not suffering in pain every day 60 hours a week.

I'm very disappointed, but it has as much to do with my wide feet as anything else.  There is probably a reason why I get along so well with my various square-toe Ariats.  I have to say the Ariats felt like putting on angel feathers after wearing these torturous monstrosities around for just one hour today.  If only Ariat made a decent looking cowboy-style boot in a steel toe.  I hate having to wear steel-toe boots, but it is what it is.","Looks good, but...",3.0,B00024U0IG

I noticed the self cleaning sole actually works really well and no noticeable loss in traction in the semi rugged terrain I was in. Ankle support is nice and it is simply comfortable.

The problem is the lining. It wrinkles near the top of the tongues.

I guess it feels that way because there IS something there: extra material...rubbing away...

"This is my second pair of Danner's. My first pair lasted 10 years, and about 100,000 miles. They are still repairable, but for $181 for a new pair, versus about $100 to fix the old ones, I thought I'd try these. They took about a day to break in, which probably had more to do with the hard heel inserts they came with. I realized I found them too hard for my feet, replaced them with a different pair of inserts, and, voila, just as comfortable as my old pair! I wear my boots for work and hiking, and have never found a better, more well-made, or more comfortable pair of boots! Danner's are a bit expensive, but they are so worth it! I work in intermittently wet conditions, and my feet stay comfortable and dry all day. Danner's also seem to conform to your feet after wearing them for a short time, but they don't stretch out. I have very wide feet, and although EE Danner's feel a little snug when you first put them on (and they don't look wide), they quickly form around your feet for a perfect fit.

"UPDATE 2:  (One year later)
I'm still wearing these boots almost every day.  They have held up very well.  They are still completely waterproof.  The soles are in excellent shape.  They are moderately comfortable.  I put some expensive sole inserts in them which helped with comfort significantly.  The leather is still garbage in my opinion.  After a little internet searching, I have come to conclude that these are made with bonded leather.  (Do an internet search if you aren't sure what that means.)  For the price, that's completely unacceptable.  Lastly, I still submit that these are not ""insulated"", but ""lined"".

UPDATE:
I originally reviewed these boots after only a week of wear, so this is an update after 6 months of wear.  This is my first pair of Danner boots.  I wear them everyday, sometimes all day.  They have been worn on a 5 mile hike and around the office.  I have had them in water.  I have provided no care (polish, oil, waterproofing, etc.)  Overall, I am disappointed in these boots for the price.  I bought them because they are ""Made In The USA"" and because there are so many good reviews and anecdotal stories of people having their Danner boots for decades with great satifaction.  I don't see that happening with these boots for me.  These are well crafted, but the materials are very poor except for the Vibram sole.

APPEARANCE:
They look just as they do in the image.  The image provided is representative.  I have worn them to the office with khakis and have gotten compliments from clients.  I haven't tried to polish them, yet.

LEATHER:
Very Poor!!  At first, I was surprised how soft the leather was and how very little break-in was necessary.  However, this is because the leather is so thin there is nothing to break-in.  Additionally, they have put some sort of rubberized coating on the leather.  It almost seems like a latex paint.  Because of this, the coloring is unnatural appearing.  Out of the box it gives the boots a soft comfortable feel.  It doesn't take long to realize this is merely superficial.  It has mostly scraped off the toe of the boot with very light use.  The only other time I have seen this is on a pair of VERY cheap boots I bought from K-Mart while I was in college.  I bought these boots to last me for years.  They're not going to make it.  The leather is garbage and very disappointing for such an expensive boot.

OUT-SOLES:
Best thing about the boots.  Quality Vibram soles as you would expect.  They are a typical lug with a middle layer of well-cushioned rubber similar, but more dense than that found on running shoes.  The Vibram part is really only the outer most layer.  This has worn very well.  I question whether the mid-sole cushioning is going to last.

LACING:
5 eyelets, 4 hooks, 1 eyelet.  Simple.  The laces are a typical nylon braid found on most utility boots.  There have been no problems keeping them laced up.  Once tied up they stay that way for the day.

INSIDE:
They are lined with a nylon fabric simply to serve as a barrier between the wearer's foot and the Gore-tex.  It seems to be holding up well.  There aren't any leaks.  I have had them up to the ankle in a creek or two.  They come with a heal-cup type insert.  This is made of a soft plastic material.  The inserts are annoying in that they have to be re-positioned every time you put the boots on.  Note, these are not insulated boots.

COMFORT and SUPPORT:
Surprisingly comfortable for the lack of support.  The cushioning in the sole contributes to that.  I find the heal inserts to help.  I haven't tried them without the inserts.  But, frankly, these boots should come with quality inserts with arch support that runs the length of the boot--especially for that price!  On the one 5 mile hike I did with these, they didn't cut it.  My feet were very sore in the end and there is zero ankle support.  Admittedly, these are not hiking boots, but 5 miles over pretty moderate terrain is hardly a hike.

SIZING:
They seem perfectly true to size and width.  There is no heal slippage and there is plenty of room in the toe-box, but not so much so that my feet are sliding around.

PRICING:
Far overpriced for the materials.

Sadly, I'll never buy Danner again.  I have a pair of Red Wing 2218 Lineman boots and they are much better boot with regard to durability and materials.  Consider the Red Wing 4585 or 214 before you buy these.",Poor materials,2.0,B0002L4ARQ

I wanted something that wouldn't take long to break in and I preferred something made in America. I got both with this boot.

"Got my boots to go hunting just a day before leaving for the trip.  Hoped they would not require break-in as other reviews suggested, and indeed, they fit great on my narrow (A/B width) feet and were flexible and comfortable right out of the box.  I did insert Super Feet orthotics in lieu of the provided half-orthotic.  It does slightly increase the height of your foot in the boot to do so, but I like the comfort and extra arch support I get with the orthotics, and didn't cause any fit problems for me.  If I had any sort of quibble with the boots, it would just be that they don't have padding at the top like the Danner's Trophy boots, but it's nothing that socks with some pad on the leg (I use snowboard socks) won't solve.  So far, they've help up well in rocky and uneven terrain, and my feet weren't tired like they usually are after trudging around all day.

The 8s didn't even last a year because of the poor design of the soles, which are not designed for serious toe draggers.

As for as sliding, the approaches are the biggest factor in that and even the most expensive shoes will have that problem.  That's why now you can buy shoes with a half a dozen soles and heels.  The best solution to sliding problems is either a sliding sock or a Teflon patch.  I prefer the patch because they don't make a sliding sock that fits me well enough.

I bowl 4-6 days a week, so I'm pretty hard on bowling shoes, but the 1s have held up very well for these two years.

I ordered 1/2 a size up since I have somewhat wide feet, and they fit fine.  They're pretty true-to-size, perhaps a little small.  I'd suggest ordering your size or 1/2 a size up, depending on your foot width, but don't order small.

"I was prepared to not like these shoes as much as I hoped.  Strange way to start a review so allow me to explain.  I have bad feet.  No getting around it, or any way to sugar coat the reality.  Bad hoofs.  That's me.  As a result, most shoes don't get the job done in terms of comfort and durability.  It's on those issues that caused concern on these Reeboks because I ordered them to use as an alternative to the sz 15 Brooks Beast shoes which I use on most of my long runs of 4 miles or more.

The Reeboks were thought to be a nice change of pace for those lighter workout days when I go only a couple of miles.  Anyway, that was the thinking.  As it turns out, my concerns were ill founded.  The Reeboks are lighter on my feet but also provide the comfort and durability that I was hoping to achieve.  They're also perfect for the gym and those 45 minute weight training sessions that I try to get in a few times each week.  Another surprise:  They can take the pounding of extended runs up to 6 miles and don't hurt my feet, although I'm not expecting to use them in that fashion very often.

The overall stability of the shoes is a little too flimsy as my right foot tends to pronate inward at the heel area for some reason once I'm warmed and up to speed.  That's a small glitch of sorts and results in a slight downgrade, thus my 4 star rating.  That aside, these shoes are better than I expected and represent a genuine value for the money.

UPDATE:  I've since ordered TWO additional pairs of these shoes in order to rotate them and spread out the wear and tear.  Obviously, these are terrific all purpose shoes in my way of seeing things.  The two newer pairs, interestingly enough, don't have the pronation problem described in the inital pair.  Why this is the case is unknown to me.  Reebok has clearly hit it out of the park with this model and series. You cannot go wrong by ordering a pair to see and feel for yourself.

UPDATE#2:  I've tried to wear them down but they have stood up to the pounding and daily use, to the point where I don't even use my heavier and more expensive Brooks or New Balance running shoes.  That's amazing to me.  The key is comfort and durability.  These Reeboks have both of those qualities so why bother to live in denial?

"The old time goods made in England were so good I am filled with sadness to think that I didn't buy ten pairs in the various colors before they stopped producing there and moved the manufacturing to China. I especially liked a lighter saddle color, and wore a pair of those many hundreds of times. Had I known at the time they would not be replacable, I would have kept them and tried to have them somehow restored. Very sad what has happened to this brand, ... that now sells crap. Poor quality, stupid designs, overpriced, with the type of promotions in their owm strip mall outlets that are insulting to ones intelligence, and making a full time business model out of cashing in on their previously fine reputation. Even if they did move it back to England now, I am sure the workmanship would not equal what had once been when their prestigious brand was known as Clarks of England. What has been done to this company in the pursuit of profits represents such poor judgement that their senior management should be criminally prosecuted.

"I'm afraid I must disagree with the other reviewers. I owned a similar pair of these which I bought almost nine years ago. They were the best shoes I ever owned. I used them for walking and in everyday use. They felt like high quality, comfortable shoes from the moment I put them on. They were made in the UK where they should have been made, and you could tell in the fine quality. This new pair was made in China and they feel like it. They are cheaply made, though the materials may be good. For the air cushion---they forgot to put in the air apparently. They are really not good for walking. For everyday use they may be ok, but if you want a comfortable shoe for walking buy something else. I would not have bought these at half the price if I had any idea how poorly they would feel. Clarks shareholders may be happy with their Chinese products, but I certainly am not. Save your money and buy somnething else made by a good shoe manufacturer...if you can still find one.

* Price - I got them (5-10 years ago) on sale for $25.
* Style - At the time, the square toe look was ""in"" even though it's gone out of style since.

Cons:
* Heavy - my shins would be a little sore after wearing them if I hadn't in a while.
* Uncomfortable - I usually only wore them for dressier occasions and they were fine but when I tried to wear them all day at work, my feet started hurting and I had to get insoles.

"Okay, first things first: I got these on sale for $30, so take that into consideration when reading this review.

These are well-made, and reasonably comfortable shoes. The picture is a little deceptive when it comes to looks. These are a little dated (probably why they're on sale), but are still relatively fashionable.

Pros:

Rubber soles wear well, don't slip, and still look good.

Quality construction; these seem very sturdy for dress shoes.

Price.

Cons:

The toe is a bit longer and more narrow than the picture suggests.

The break-in period has lasted a bit longer than I am used to (about 3 weeks).

"These are some good quality slip-ons, I've had for about 5-6 months now and they have been great for me.  When you first get them you might be skeptical but give them a try like I did and they'll probably end up being something you want to wear almost every day.  Style matches the ""dress casual"" look I'm always trying to achieve.

Fit is good, leather is good quality and holds a decent polish but doesn't scuff that easily easily.  The shoe is comfortable without any fancy insoles or sole, lightweight and just flexible enough when you're on your feet a fair amount.  I even wore them one time while I was moving some boxes for about 3-4 hours because I accidentally forgot to bring a change of sneakers with me.  This was after wearing them the entire day at work.

Pretty good deal even though they're made in China.  Definitely more comfortable than the squared toe lace-ups with hard soles from Nordstrom Rack I had been wearing and quality is about the same.  They take a while to break in for some reason, but once you do they will feel like you've had them all along and the cushioned sole, while not impressive to look at when you first see them, is ideal.

I immediately noticed the focus on comfort given to this shoe. There is felt material in the interior where the toes rest, leather outer and an overall lightweight feel. They are definitely my most comfortable casual shoes.

However, the original shoe I bought in 1973 and for many years thereafter was made in Ireland and had a steel shank. I also believe the sole was of a different material. Although the same shoe could be manufactured in a different country, these are really not the same as there is no steel shank. I have 3 older pairs like this one in the closet and I needed to start replacing them; however the finish was poor on them and they didn't feel quite right and returned them.

I exchanged them for a full size smaller and they fit all right, but they're incredibly heavy and inflexible. When I tried walking in them they were so stiff that my heels kept coming out of them. I sent them back. I have no complaint about the quality -- the stitching looked even and the leather was high quality -- but I can't wear them.

"These boots are well made and comfortable. They are reasonably warm, OK down to maybe -10 F, and waterproof as advertised. The zippers work really well.

The 8s didn't even last a year because of the poor design of the soles, which are not designed for serious toe draggers.

As for as sliding, the approaches are the biggest factor in that and even the most expensive shoes will have that problem.  That's why now you can buy shoes with a half a dozen soles and heels.  The best solution to sliding problems is either a sliding sock or a Teflon patch.  I prefer the patch because they don't make a sliding sock that fits me well enough.

"I bought this pair of boots about seven years ago in Fairbanks, AK. I wanted a stiff hunting boot that would last a lifetime, and this boot does not disapoint. The soles are round and are made for very uneaven terrain do not use on pavement or around town unless the roads are muddy, unpaved, or rocky. There is insulation but you really have to keep active otherwise your toes will get cold and once these boots get cold your done these boots are so thick that it is inpossible to get your feet warm again unless you take them off in a heated cabin. Example I wore these boots to a village in western Alaska they provided great staibility being made of thick quality leather and stiff rugged soles. Walking on these unmaintained roads with ice and packed snow was great, walked about two miles from the village airstrip to the meeting hall no problems at all. The weather was too cold for my day hikers but not cold enough for bunny boots or my really cold weather boots, so I wore these. When the meeting was finished and I was waiting at the airstrip for my scheduled flight my toes froze; plane was ninty minutes late, temp was about 4 to -4 degrees F with north winds blowing in the teens. Once on the plane (Caravan) it took the whole fourty-five minutes ride back to Nome to get the feeling back into my toes, the pain of the blood returning to my toes was pretty bad, not a problem with the boot mind you but if you need a boot and you plan to be static for any amount of time in cold weather look eslewhere. So I will countine to use these boots for fall moose hunting and caribou hunting in September and October only, these really are fantistic boots for this purpose.

"Wore these on several hikes to break them in.
Then, wore them on a true mountain climb.  They worked well with crampons and traction on climb.  They were warm, dry and fairly comfortable, although a bit narrow.  On the descent, slightly different story.  Constant rain caused them to get somewhat damp.  This caused sliding inside the boot with wool socks.  The sliding caused bumping into the toe bumper, which caused loss of both big toe toenails.  I only say I blame the shoe somewhat because other than my boots, I was dry.  And, I was dry while traversing the glacier.  Since the climb, I have only worn them sparingly on winter walks.  They do not perform well on solid (concrete surfaces) due to the hard sole and act more similarly to a hockey skate than a hiking shoe.",Extreme mountaineering = Performed as expected,3.0,B0007DBK40

"Having done a couple several-day trips in the high Sierras with these boots, I can say they are excellent mountaineering boots. They are quite comfortable and didn't require any break-in time, but the sole is sufficiently stiff for kicking steps, wearing crampons, etc. The one drawback is that they don't have a lot of insulation, so your toes will get cold after a lot of time in the snow. On the other hand, that means your feet won't get so hot if you use them for backpacking at lower elevations or in the summer. As for fit, I normally wear about a US size 10, but I sized up to a 44 so they wouldn't be too tight with thick socks or two pairs of socks.

"I'm on my 4th pair of these boots. It is my summer long distance hiking and mountaineering go to boot - light, supportive, zero break-in, never had a blister. Waterproof enough for stream crossings with gaiters, but for longer exposure to wet stuff you should sno-seal all the leather and seams to keep the water from creeping in (also happens on my winter Trango Prime).

The boot is rather narrow, so don't just buy this based on a size chart. I wear a US 11, maybe 10.5 if the shoe is large. For me the Trango needs to be Euro 45 to fit well, and if I were to add an aftermarket insole, it needs to be 45.5

Seams hold up for the life of the soles. I currently have two pair that have seen about 600 miles each (Muir Trail twice each and other trips) and the rubber still looks good enough for one or two more. I have no idea if you can re-sole these easily.

My son and daughter also hike in Trango S Evo GTX boots, and have the same experiences. Great modern boot for those who think trail runners are just asking for ankle injuries, or if you venture to places where some crampons may be a good idea.",Hope they never change this boot,5.0,B0007DBK40

I never slipped once.  Comfort in the water is 10 out of 10.  Out of the water without any type of sock on, the comfort is still a 7 out of 10",Great!!!,5.0,B0002528IU
"Very comfortable shoe, exactly what I needed for my trip to Costa Rica and all the outdoor adventures. Love the quick drying action and I wouldn't hesitate to use these for other activities. I have wide feet but these shoes have enough give so I felt no discomfort during the break-in period. Nicely made and excellent quality!",nice shoe,5.0,B0002528IU
"Everything about this shoes is great. It looks like sneakers but is capable of handling wet conditions.

I hiked the Na Pali coast on Kauai and other Hawaiian island trails that are wet and dry without any problems.

The only bad thing is that the bottom is slippery when you walk on rocks that are underwater and have those ""slimy"" buildup.

Other than that, this shoes is awesome!",Great Shoes,4.0,B0002528IU

"This was my second pair of water shoes. They performed better than I had expected. We took a five mile hike down Sulphur Creek at Capital Reef in Utah, in and out of the water all afternoon and waking down dry trails. They remained comfortable and gave excellent traction while hiking through the creek on wet rocks and also on dry land. OK. The weather was very dry and warm, so their drying time may have been aided by the environment. I placed them outside at about 5 PM to dry. By 8 PM they were virtually dry. I can recommend this product.","Comfortable, Great Traction, Fast Drying",5.0,B0002528IU

"I am looking at purchasing my third pair of these boots, I typically get two seasons because I drag my toes. I currently play in a dry climate with harder surfaces. I don't even bother looking at other brands because these conform so nicely to my feet, are very light and give me a great touch on the ball. I first purchased because I'm old school when soccer players wore black and these fit the bill, but to my surprise they were not only solid black but an absolutely comfortable fit. **I Love My Boots**",Love My Boots!,5.0,B00009PPHY
"I love Puma boots and have been wearing them for years.  I usually buy kangaroo skin, but those only last me for a season or two (I play 3 times a week). So I thought I would try good old fashion leather.  The fit is still GREAT, no blisters at all.  But the leather is a bit hard and I can feel it with my touch.  I am sure it will get better over time and perhaps the hard leather will help these boots last more than 6-9 months for me!",Fit is GREAT Leather is Hard,4.0,B00009PPHY

"So far I'm extremely pleased with these shoes. Quite comfortable, stable and supportive. Really don't know what more you could ask for in a sub $40 pair of tennis shoes. Thus far they have exceeded my expectations.",Excellent value shoe,4.0,B0000ACXKC
"Unfortunately, the shoes I have ordered are not for sale anymore in The Netherlands. Don't ask me why, because only in the small town I am living in, more tennis players are interested in them. It could therefore well be that Amazon will receive more orders for them. With my relatively small and wide feet and my sensitive Achilles tendon, these shoes were by far the very best shoes I could find some years ago. I am very happy that Amazon still can deliver them and I have ordered two pair to make sure that I can play tennis for the next years to come.",The best tennis shoes for me!,5.0,B0000ACXKC
