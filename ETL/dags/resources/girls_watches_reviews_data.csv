"This made a GREAT gift for a 6 year old. It is colorful (flowery)and stylish (purple and pink are her fav colors). She was quite excited and didn't want to take it off for night.

"Hi, I will recommend this timepiece to any child....It's easy to read because a child will easily read the time correctly with all the instructions on the face of the watch.  My young daughter loves it.  Unfortunately, one was taken from her without her knowing, so here I am buying another.  It is REALLY a time teacher!!!
It's also durable and attractive to look at which are pluses...
When the band is dirty, just remove it and wash - it looks as good as new!",Excellent time piece,5.0,B0000TIKK8

I bought this watch for my 8 year old daughter about 2 months ago. She thinks that it is nice and pretty and likes how it displays the hours and minutes. She wanted me to give it a 4-star review because the wristband gets dirty very quickly. The shipping was fast and I feel like the price was appropriate.,Nice watch for the price,4.0,B0000TIKK8
"Works great and holds up well! Been kicked around, buried in toy boxes, etc more than it's been on the wrist, but it still looks new and works perfect!

"I bought one of these (with lizards) for my 4 year old grandson's birthday.  I wanted a watch with hands so he could really learn to tell time.  The watch band fits his tiny wrist and the waterproofing worked great when he forgot to take it off and wore it during a swimming lesson.  He loves the backlight (which he tries to use as a flashlight though it's not bright enough).  He's gradually getting the concept of time and wears it ALL the time.

"I purchased 2 watches for my two 3 year old grandchildren. The delivery was prompt. When I saw the watches, I thought they were just perfect except for the writing on watch hands.

Overall, the watch is perfect for young children even if you cant really read the words on the hands but at least they are color coded. The way the watch is made, it is very useful in helping the children to start to learn the time. My grandchildren also get a BIG sense of pride while wearing them cause they feel like such BIG BOYS. Boys being boys, they are very rough and dirty. I haven't had any problems with the watches so far. Washing the band is so easy and comfortable for them to wear.

the strap is fairly sturdy too so far (thats 3 weeks or so). have no idea how it will fare once he starts wearing it regularly! the buckle is easy to operate and doesnt hurt the toddler's wrist. it doesnt loosen on its own either.

would have given it 5 stars but that the dial seems a little cluttered with the picture of the tractor etc. its a little hard for me to teach the child what to focus on!",timely speaking,4.0,B000SZMOGA
"I bought this watch for my son 2 years ago as a preschool graduation gift. He wore it occasionally for the first year, then pretty much daily for most of the last year. I selected this watch because I trust Timex and because of the stretch band. Other kids watches that he tried on were still too big, even when adjusted to the smallest setting. But with the stretch band, this one fits great and is very easy for him to put on and take off by himself (we had ZERO problems with the band loosening, as another reviewer mentioned). It recently stopped working - while the hour hand still works fine, the minute hand spins freely if you give the watch a little shake. However, we have been happy with the watch, so I'm browsing to buy him another one! Will probably buy one for my daughter soon too.",Love the stretch band,4.0,B000SZMOGA
"My kids really love the Timex Kids' Time Teacher watches - we have one with a purple monkey stretch band and one with a blue band with cars and trucks.  We looked around for the longest time before finding these watches - our kids wanted watches, but we really struggled to find simple, inexpensive analog kids' watches (you'd think it would be pretty simple!).

PROS
+ display is very easy to read

+ band has cool and interesting graphics on it that kids want to wear

+ inexpensive watch

+ your kids learn to tell time with a real watch

+ durable watch

+ watch is easy to put on

CONS
- Not all of the watches seem to have a second hand

- Not all of the watches are as legible as others

- No date feature on the watch

My niece was about to celebrate her 7th birthday. I wanted to expand my gift idea this time around. It wasn't until I placed the order, I realized this was not a Hello Kitty product. It was simply a kitten product. I am not sure why it is in the Hello Kitty search. I was nervous about that since my niece is a huge fan of the real Hello Kitty. I awaited feedback from my sister. She said my niece absolutely adore her watch/jewelry set. She wears it to school daily. That made me feel good! I am happy I chose this. I made an incredible impression with this gift set. I later received an email from Amazon saying this set comes with a 2 year warranty good for specific things. That information also makes this gift a winner. I would buy this again.

"I must have looked at a dozen or more Lego watches.  I would have sworn they were rubber.  This one is not; it's plastic.  It's been dropped a few times and has survived thus far.  My 4 year old goes through phases of wearing it so it's not a 24/7 thing for him.  What's nice is you can take each piece (color) apart and arrange it in whatever order you want, other than the two black pieces that make up the clasp.  I like that it isn't character specific, like Star Wars, Toy Story or Cars, nor is it outrageous colors that will never go with anything.  I think you can also mix and match with pieces from other Lego watches (as long as they aren't rubber) so if you have a broken one or want a different face, it's nice to be able to mix it up. Also, I like the analog face so that my son can learn to tell time the REAL way and not just digitally. I only gave it 4 stars because the plastic is hard and he sweats under it.  I think that's the main reason my son won't wear it.  For the price, though, it's a great watch, especially for little ones learning to tell time.",Not what I thought . . .,4.0,B001M9JDGU
We ordered this watch for our 10 year old avid lego fan.  He was thrilled.  Found the watch to be a little on the small side (face only).

"I owned another LEGO watch in the same kids' size for over 10 years. After a half-dozen battery changes, it still kept perfect time ... until its trip through the clothes washer. I chose the City watch to replace it, so that I could have a wider variety of links for the band (they're the same size and shape of the links on my original watch). This new one keeps time just as well, and the watch gets just as many compliments.

If you're an adult female, I recommend the kids' size watch. I tried out the adult size, but it's more of a man's size -- it looked huge on my little she-wrist. This one is the perfect size. And the perfect price -- what other $25 watch will last 10 years? If it gets dirty, just take the links apart and scrub them with soapy water and an old toothbrush. Easy!","Kids, schmids.

"Was really disappointed to have to give this a low review.  Let me break it down for any of you fence-sitters really quickly:

If you want to get a ""Wow! Awesome!!!"" reaction from a child when they open this gift, you will achieve that end. If you want a functioning watch, look elsewhere.

The pieces are cheaply made and come undone too easily which led my particular 8 year old to tears in crying that his watch was ""Stupid!"" I generally discourage emotional outbursts over petty matters, but his frustration was absolutely warranted.  That a gift he had such excitement and hope for was effectively worthless really was heartbreaking.

On the other hand, the basic kid's Timex, velcro strapped watch we bought our other son last year has held up beautifully and is still going strong. ($15 at Walmart.  Amazon used to sell it but I can't find it on here anymore as of the date of this review.)

Bottom line, if you want a time piece, get one.  If you want legos, buy them.  You shouldn't expect to meet both goals in this product.

"My daughter really loves these watches, and I say that in plural.  We have now gone through 2 of them.  The first time was sort of her fault, she wore it in the shower for a minute, these watches are definitely not water resistant, and the water warped the inside face.  then the band broke in a separate incident.  So was she too hard on the watch?  The jury is still out on that one.  Then, as a surprise, because she really loved the watch, I bought her another one.  This lasted about 3-4 weeks, and she was just walking along at a store with me and it fell of, but we had all the parts.  It was the pin that goes between the watch and the band.  Overall I give the cuteness of the watch a 5 for girls that are pre-teen.  The quality is about a 2, it does keep time but is obviously cheaply made.  I give the band a 3, it breaks easily, it is rubber and looks cool and comfortable, so it does get an ok grading.  I think this is a watch you would be taking your chances on but you can usually get it for under $20.  With that being said, if you want quality you can find better quality for maybe double the price if you look for some other watches.","Cute cute, but band breaks",3.0,B004BYJXRC

"This was the second one that I had ordered for my daughter's 9th birthday.  The first fell apart after one day, the second within a few hours after we realized that it was not on her wrist anymore!  She found it on her bedroom floor, broken.  I think the problem is that the rods do not stay in the little grooves on the watch face piece, that hold the straps on to the watch.  Also, the replacement one (the second one) that arrived had a different face - the peace sign was not purple, but tie-dyed!  The band was not as pretty either.  We were really disappointed.  How this company and Amazon can keep selling this is beyond me.  Others must have had the same issues!  I returned both of them for my money back.

I did still give it 2 stars because I do like the look of the watch (with the purple peace sign).  I was able to keep putting it back together with some effort and frustration.  It is a nice quality face.  The first one had a better-looking band.

Too easy to swap bands. It keeps unclicking from the watch face causing it to get lost. My son isn't wearing his anymore.

My son is extremely small for his age. He had to use the bigger band. so If your child is older than 5, this may be too small. My son is the size of an avg. 4yr old and really skinny.

IMO it came with too many pieces. There's 2 bands, 2 extra snap on rings for the watch face and the alien. I think it had bricks, too.",looks great!,4.0,B004LLK6MQ

"My 5 year old loves this watch and wears it everywhere.  We've had it for 3 months and the face is scratched, but still readable.  The band is frayed from rubbing on the buckle that holds it in place.  It had started loosening on it's own during the day and I had to sew the band so that he wouldn't lose it.

"I purchased this watch for my 4 year old, who loves Grandma's Timex watch due to the Indiglo function. It is lightweight, easy to adjust and colorful. And it does have Indiglo. The numbers are clear, at least initially. After several weeks of regular use, the face of this watch is totally scratched up. Kids are a lot harder on watches than adults (since grown-ups usually don't spend a good part of their day playing outside - sad, but true), and I was hoping Timex might account for that with scratch resistant faces. I was wrong. It is difficult to tell time when the face is so scratched up. It is too bad, because it is otherwise a great watch for a young child. Just the right size and shape.","Scratches easily, looks old fast",2.0,B004VRA9K4
"My 6 year-old was so happy with this watch.  The band is probably the best part, being so comfortable and adjustable.  The indiglo is also popular with my son.  I like how the minute numbers are on the watch (5, 10, 15, 20...) to help my son learn to tell time.",Great watch for kids,5.0,B004VRA9K4

"Having watched my kid wearing it for a few months now, this watch has accumulated a fine set of scratches on its face (as mentioned from other reviewers).  However, keeping in mind that it's under the care of a 5-year-old, I would expect this amount of wear and tear with any watch.  In addition, the fabric wristband gets dirty and I find myself washing it with soap.  On the positive side, it seems comfortable and is easy for a kid to slip on, but overtime, the watchband becomes looser with wear and slips off too easily.

From previous experience with other Timex watches, I would recommend the Timex Kids' watch with velcro wristband instead.",Okay given that a kid's taking care of it,3.0,B004VRA9K4

"The watch face is great - helps them learn to tell time.  Also has the timex indiglo feature which is exciting for kids.

My one complaint is that the band is hard even for me to fasten and take off.  I think it is meant for them to slip off as it has some stretch to it.  But I would prefer a simple loop and some velcro, like Timex's other kids watches.  This enables the child to put on their own watch and take it off with ease (my older son has the digital flames velcro strap watch from Timex which has this feature).","Good watch, but band is not really age appropriate",3.0,B004VRA9K4

"Let me start by saying that I think these learning watches are an excellent idea.  It is a fantastic way for kids to learn how to tell time correctly and avoid using digital.  Several years back I bought some for friends children and everyone raved about them.  So now that my own daughter is 5 and I want to start teaching her how to tell time, I settled on this one.  Well, here comes the disappointment.  The ""learning"" numbers (the numbers on the outside by 5's to help children learn the minutes) are so small, they are virtually unreadable and useless.  I thought maybe it was just the light coloring of this watch, but I looked at the other styles in a retail store and they are all the same.  Very surprised by Timex.  Cute watch and I will give it to her, but can't say the ""minute"" numbers will aid in any way.",Disappointed,2.0,B004VRD7XU

"I bought this watch for my bright 4-year old daughter, who could tell time from a digital clock.  I wanted her to be able to learn to tell time on an analogue watch.  This did the trick.  She can see how the pink hour hand corresponds to the pink hour designations, and the blue minute hand corresponds to the tiny blue-ringed minute designations (printed on the face of the watch - click on the Amazon image to enlarge).  We have purchased several of these watches for several of our children.  I like the price, since often enough the children lose their watches.  They are NOT waterproof, beware; different websites advertise different levels of water-resistance.  These Timex  watches are OK for splashes, but not pool or bath use.  (Tried all three, had to replace the bath and pool dipped ones.)  Also, the plastic faces tend to scratch very easily, but my children don't mind terribly.  The light-colored band does get somewhat dirty, quickly, but again, my daughter didn't seem to notice.  All said, I'd buy these again, happily.","good educational value, good price",4.0,B004VRD7XU

The watch has lots of fun things to do. My boys set alarms for different things, timed everything they could, and toggled between 12 and 24 h times (6pm or 1800). They needed a little help figuring out how to do it, but got it going quickly.

The watch has been in the shower a few times with no problems, but we try to keep it out as a general rule. It has been dropped and even thrown, and it looks as good as new.

She can't really tell the time, but the band will grow with her. It is something she will be able to wear for years, if she wants, and we have fun talking about what time it is.

It is not easy for her to change the time either, which is good, because she will spin the numbers on the outside. I am glad I picked it up on a whim, and she loves pretending to tell the time, as we are teaching her how to really tell it.","Great beginner watch, which will grow with her!",5.0,B005OVCW92

She said that she never touched the stem, but everyday the thing would stop a few hours after I set it.  As an experiment on the weekend I set it and didn't let her wear it.  I checked it every so often and lo and behold it worked for about 3 hours before it simply STOPPED.  I reset it and the same thing happen.  It wasn't about to drop any money to see if they sent a faulty battery, so I decided to get her a Timex instead.

The watch teaches children to tell time, the hand says hour and minutes, also the outside dial teaches to read minutes.

"Bought this watch to reward a young learner for excelling in telling time. Watch was supposedly licensed by Disney, but with no standards implied. The bezel clicks as expected at times, and then sticks at times almost as if it will break from poor cutting/assembly. The batter died on 1 of the two watches bought, after only 1 day of use, despite the winding arm being disengaged to stop time functioning. The band itself was poorly cut and beginning to fray in places, and the velcro to secure the band to the watch as well as the wrist was exposed to the skin.
At the end of the day, I did still like the watch, the intended design and idea is wonderful. But the poor quality of ewatchfactory items and the ridiculous prices for what you get will lead me elsewhere next time. The recipient also liked the styling of the watch itself, but the band itched and irritated them each time they put it on until they finally gave up the fight after about 3 days. For $12-15 I'd probably buy another band and suck up the loss when the quality of the watch gives in, but for the listed price of $30, I already feel like a sucker.
For anyone facing the DOA issue as I did with the battery. These cases require a watch case press to get the backs on again, unless you have a rubber coated pliers and a lot of luck not cracking the crystal.","Neat idea, but a Novely watch",2.0,B005OVCW92

The only issue I really have is that the green disc around the outside with the minutes twists around and instead of ""00"" at the top it has ""60"" the other 3 watches I've purchased for my boys have zero for o'clock. I found it easier for them to learn. My son plays with the disc so at any time he may have the ""05"" over the four instead of the number one.

The purple leather band is very nice, good quality and not bulky.  The color is a little deeper than the picture (again, better than I was expecting).  The face of the watch is durable too, it's not a flimsy piece of plastic. I like that it doesn't have an outer bezel that turns.

"This ""time to tell time"" watch is a great idea for teaching children how to tell time.

The watch features a moving bezel marked in 5 minute increments, similar to a diver's watch. If you turn the bezel so the ""60"" is above the 12 on the dial then the numbers on the bezel will indicate both the minutes and the seconds after the hour. If you move the ""60"" on the bezel to the current position of the minute hand, then that point in time is marked and a child could easily tell you how many minutes have passed since then.

It comes with a cardboard display to further practice telling time and to possibly quiz the child.

The dial is mainly white. The hour and minute hands are different colors,which is good, but the hour & minute hands (especially the hour hand)are also hard to see. In my opinion they should be darker colors for easy viewing without eye strain.",Cute Watch for Little Girls,4.0,B005OVKLX6
"My just turned 5 daughter loves everything pink, but isn't into worrying about time yet, so this watch was more of an accessory than an educational device. My first grade son is gradually learning to read clocks, but this style isn't for him.

Build quality seems good with a durable face and a metal back. A wide range of wrist sizes are supported by the Velcro band, certainly any sub-second grade girl should fit. Setting the time is easy enough, perhaps too easy as twiddling youngsters are likely to play around and mis-set it. The minute dial is easily read by children who know their double digit numbers. I'm not sure if there's any good reason for having a curved second hand, and I'd rather they had not done so.

All in all, an OK watch, but do little kids really need watches?",Nicely Made,4.0,B005OVKLX6
"I gave this to a friend's daughter who is 6 years old. She can't understand how a watch and a clock are the same thing, and is having trouble telling time. Before getting this watch, she was in tears when we would try to explain to her 'big hand' and 'little hand' and what they mean.

When she saw this watch, I was instantly her new best friend! She felt so grown up, she had a watch like mommy and daddy now! And it clicked for her, seeing the hands that are labeled, the correlation between the clock on the wall and how it translates to a watch. She shows everyone her 'big girl watch' and is still learning time, but she's getting there. She can't wait for someone to ask her what time it is, and she makes a point to show everyone that she has this watch.

I didn't expect the quality on this to be so nice, but this watch is sturdy. The band is comfortable and non-chafing and infinitely adjustable. I know it's durable because the 6 year old has a 4 year old sister constantly trying to take this watch from her and it's surviving! Mom is going to buy the 4 year old her own watch for Christmas to end the ""War of the Watch""!

"My daughter loved this watch, and couldn't wait to wear it to school. She loves pink, which was a bonus. The watch is pictured well, but the velcro band was very uncomfortable for her and she said she had to take it off....my daughter will usually suffer through any kind of ""fashion"" statement, if she likes it, so this must have been VERY uncomfortable for her because she loves it. She still says she loves it, but does not wear it very often. The strap itself is rough against her wrist and because she has a thin wrist, it does not strap tightly and moves around more. I don't know how this helps her to tell time. The little paper cut-outs are already gone. If you don't lose them you will tear them. They should have been made out of some kind of plastic. I think that would be more durable. Still, the clock keeps good time and looks nice. This is a 3.5 star product, but gets a nod to 4 because my daughter is learning how to tell time with it. More so because she likes the watch. This would be 5 star product if it were more comfortable. I have not been able to test it in a pool, but will update if any problem occurs. At this point, I think that the rest of the watch is made well, and the stainless steel is a nice touch. My daughter also loves to rotate the bezel.","Nice watch, uncomfortable to wear for any length of time.",4.0,B005OVKLX6
"Read on for my full review, but in summary: I wanted to love it, but I can only like it for the following reasons: (1) I wanted something my daughter would be able to wear, and the bulk and scratchiness of the wristband prevents that and (2) the description of the accompanying time-teaching materials was exaggerated. She is learning from it, though, so that's good, even though it can't fully be used as intended.

Watch face: My daughter has learned to read ""hour"" and ""minute"" and knows the difference between the two now. She is learning to tell time well as a result. Win on the educational front!

Wristband: It can fit my (small to average sized adult female) wrist at one of the largest settings, and at the smallest, it fits my willowy five-year-old daughter, so the size range is wide. The positive is that the velcro adjustability allows it to fit any wrist, but the webbing plus the velcro makes the band so thick that my daughter finds it uncomfortable. It left red scratch marks on her wrist, even when loosened. Because of this, she attaches the watch to bags or dolls or other items but refuses to wear it on her wrist.

Colors: As pictured.

Teaching tool: As you see in the last picture for the item, a time-telling tool is included. I was very disappointed by the quality. Yes, it does look like the picture, but it is such a flimsy cardboard that it tore almost immediately as I was move the hands. I cannot imagine how they expected a child to handle it - even the most gentle child - without reducing it to scraps.",Decent teaching tool but the wristband is too scratchy for regular wearings,3.0,B005OVKLX6
"My girls (6 and 7) love this watch! The size is perfect, it feels sturdy and durable, and they can both read it. The rotating bezel is fun to turn, so it usually ends up a little askew, but I think remembering how to align it correctly is a good step in learning to tell time. The design is fun and, as described, whimsical. Overall, I'd recommend it highly to other parents who want to help their children learn to tell time.","Adorable, Functional Watch",5.0,B005OVKLX6
"My daughter loves this watch primarily for the color pink and butterflies on the dial.
She is able to read the hour, but still learning how to lookup the minutes, that is definitely a good start.

What is good about the watch:
  - Stainless steel (sturdy and durable):  most of other kids watches are plastic
  - Pink color - a big thing for most girls !
  - Velcro fastener - easy to remove for a kid

What is not good:
  - 33 feet water resistant - which is not great, it means it cannot sustain heavy water usage for a kid
  - Expensive

"My niece likes this watch well enough, but she may be biased because she is 5 and likes anything pink.  She also likes wearing ""jewelry"", which she thinks this is.  She can tell time, so I can't say that the included instructions were useful, but I thought that was unique.  It looks like a good way to engage a kid in how to tell time.  Most kids don't know how to read an analog watch these days (that's a watch with a dial, to you kids out there) so it's nice to have one that emphasizes how to read it.  I find the text impossibly small on the watch itself.  Can kids read that teeny-tiny microscopic print?  Well, even if they don't the watch is nice enough for a 5 year old girl who likes anything pink.","Cute, sturdy watch - but ultra-tiny print hard to read!",3.0,B005OVKLX6

Yes, it's under warranty but I have to pay to ship it back to the manufacturer and then I have to pay about $8 for a processing fee.

"A PRETTY FACE:  The face of the watch is pretty, with nice colors and an attractive butterfly theme.  I actually like how the second hand is a curved antenna, even if it's a little hard to read that way.

Though the hour hand is hard to see, as the dial is white and the hand is as well.  That's a real mistake in a watch meant to help teach time - the hands should be very easy to see.

A CLUNKY, LARGE BAND:  There's one big plus to the band - it uses velcro to make it easy to attach and adjust.

But the band is so thick and clunky that it's not that comfortable for our six year old.

Just as importantly, the band doesn't size down small enough to fit her.  Even at the maximum tightness, it's still too loose.  While this is a common problem with watches, I'd think that a teaching watch for girls would do a better job of comfortably fitting younger girls.

The cardboard time telling kit that is included is a nice idea, but they should have spent a few more pennies to make something more durable and usable.

So some good ideas, but not well executed in some ways.  On balance, I can't really recommend this watch for small children.  (If older girls or women find it attractive, it may work better for them.)","Pretty, but with a clunky, large band that may be better for older girls",3.0,B005OVKLX6

"My 11 year old daughter loves this watch. The included time telling learning cards are more geared toward younger girls. My daughter took it out, read the instructions, set the time and was off to go. All of her friends admire the watch and even a teacher complimented her on it. The solid plastic case and velcro strap appear capable of taking the abuse a young child can dish out. The velcro closure not only makes it easier for children to put on and remove the watch themselves, but eliminates fussy buckles which can break. Overall, any young girl should love this watch. The only downside is that the band tends to get dirty fairly quickly, especially with an active child. And there is no way to remove the band to wash.

This watch is well-made and it can stand up to all the things that active young kids can dish out as they play. In summary, an excellent choice of gift for a young child.",Excellent gift for a young girl.,4.0,B005OVKLX6

"This watch is cute, and being used by my 4 year old daughter. As described, it offers labels for hours and minutes for easy time reading learning.

The band is a bit strange to put on at first, but I can see where they got the idea to make it this way, to make it secure and easy for kids to hang on to during the day, along all their play times and activities.

My daughter likes this watch and is more interested in telling time and knowing time now. Her skin is not irritated by the watch material. The watch is steel and the band is nylon velcro. The watch is a bit big, and that in my opinion is good, it does not feel like a toy, but an actual watch.

The price could be a bit cheaper though, like between 15 to 20, instead of the 25, and hence the 4 stars instead of 5. You never know prices though, at Amazon, may just drop to this level anytime.","good idea, cute watch",4.0,B005OVKLX6
"This is a pretty, well-made watch that could help an older child learn to tell time. It is made of stainless steel and has a nylon velcro band. It is pink and the watch face is adorned with butterflies. The ""second"" hand is a balloon.

Although a cute watch, the primary purpose is to assist in teaching a child to tell time. For example, the hour and minute hands are labeled as such. Also, it comes with a cardboard time telling kit. It seems like it could be effective for some children, since they can see time-telling in action and read the words on their actual watch.

I tried it out on my four year old daughter. She thought the watch looked great and wore it occasionally. However, it's too big for her wrist and she's a little too young to teach how to use an analog watch. For one, her reading skills aren't quite up to ""hour"" and ""minute."" Also, experts put telling time in general at the 5-6 age range of child development.

Overall, this is a decorative, sturdy watch that most girls will find attractive. The time teaching techniques are intriguing and should help some children learn to read a watch. However, it is probably better for older kids, judging by the size of the band and the actual developmental ability to learn to tell time.","Great, but for older kids",4.0,B005OVKLX6
"This Red Balloon Kids Time Teacher Watch is cute, to say the least.  This model is decked out in butterflies and various tones of pink.  The band is made of nylon, latches with velcro, and seems like a great size for kids 8 and under.

The watch is said to by hypoallergenic and arrives in a white bubble casing.  Packaged along side the watch is a quick guie ton how to tell time with moveable hands so you can assist your child in learning!

"This is a watch with a great idea but is ultimately flawed in execution.  Here are the pros and cons as I see them:

Pros:
* It's a very cute working watch.  A watch needs to work and look good while doing it right?
* Velcro strap is easy to use.
* Includes carboard time teacher tool in package.
* Hands are printed on and color coded. ""Hours"" and ""Minutes"" are printed on their respective hands.

Cons:
* Strap is too large.  How many people are going to need to learn to tell time and will have an adult sized wrist?  Strap barely fits on my 6yo daughters arm.
* Outer bezel turns.  Yes, this is normal on most adult watches but when you're trying to teach your child to read the minutes off it and it accidentally moves, or they move it because they're playing with it, they're now reading the wrong time.  It should've been stationary.
* Curved second hand. It's stylish but also distracting and makes reading it that much more difficult.  Honestly, I think a second hand should have been ommitted.
* Included time teacher tool.  It's a great idea but it's also on cheap card stock and therefore isn't very durable.  Could have been a LOT better at only a fractional cost increase.

Summary:
A working and stylish kids watch would get 5 stars, and if that's all you care about this should work well on a larger kids wrist.  But if you want this to be the end all-be all time teaching watch is could have been, all the mentioned nitpicks really bring it down.","Great Idea, Flawed Execution",3.0,B005OVKLX6
My 7 year old daughter was very excited about this watch. She it learning to tell time on analog clocks and this really helps.

"As the product picture shows, this is a very cute watch.  With the little butterflies on the face and the red balloon second hand, it is sure to keep a child's interest.

As some others have stated, the watch band is a little stiff and scratchy.  This will probably soften in time but it might irritate a small wrist.  The actual quality of the watch seems very good for the price.

Most children would enjoy the package with the see-through case.  This also makes for easy gift wrapping or as a stocking stuffer.

I didn't think that the time telling instructions that came with the watch were very clear and could use some improvements.  And I also wonder how many children will actually be using a watch with hands in the future.  Most kids have digital watches or use their cell phones.  I see very few young people wearing watches at all.",Very cute learner watch,4.0,B005OVKLX6

"This Red Balloon watch is a pretty good watch when it comes down to it. It's fairly durable, not expensive, stylish and easily adjustable thanks to the velcro strip. I wish watches like this existed when I was younger! As soon as it arrived in the mail, my daughter couldn't wait to try it on, and wore it for a couple of days before she pointed out something that docks the score down. But she does like to wear it, and we're working on teaching her how to tell time. In doing so, I've noticed an additional problem which might not apply for everyone.

The watch has a stainless steel case, nylon strap, a plastic bezel and is supposedly water resistant up to 33 feet. I don't know who's going to be letting their kids in 33 feet of water, but the watch should be just fine when they're in an appropriately sized pool. A few people have mentioned that the watch survived a trip to their washing machines, so that's a good sign that the water resistance bit is reliable. The design of the watch is good, though I don't care for the curved second hand. All of the usual numbers and features on a simple watch are here. No Roman numerals are here to throw off your child. Adjusting the time is easy to do, as is adjusting the strap. The watch comes with a little pamphlet/time teaching table that can be useful, but teaching time is just one of those things that kids learn quickly once they get the difference between the little hand and the big hand...then work on the numbers shown on the watch. Still, it's a nice addition that a lot of watches I had as a kid never came with.

Now for the two issues my daughter and I have with the watch. My problem is that the print on the face is very small. Yes, it's obviously going to be small since this is a kid's watch, but I did a double take when I looked over the numbers. My daughter also mentioned that the velcro started to itch after a while. She'll wear it for a little bit before having to adjust re-adjust it so the scratchy part isn't touching her skin. I had a watch with a velcro strap a few years ago, so I know exactly what she means. Kids with sensitive skin might not be too fond of this one.

Just be aware of those two issues before buying and you'll be fine. This really is a cute watch and it's good to see one used as a time teacher of sorts.",You won't be late because time has a way about being on time.,4.0,B005OVKLX6
"As per usual, when my children test something - they really test it. The first day my daughter owned this watch, she managed to scratch the face. The following weekend, she put the watch in the wash. It survived (yay!) which is why I am giving it 4 stars instead of 3.

Pros:
1) Cute watch without characters (my daughter's interest seems to wane season to season).
2) easy to strap on
3) clear face with second hand indicators
4) it survived the wash machine test

Cons:
1) scratchy wristband
2) wide wristband
3) heavy watch (it is heavier than mine)
4) curved second hand

Bottom line: I like the watch - most importantly my second grader was able to tell time without problems with this watch within a couple days.

I purchased this watch for my 7 year old son and the two star rating is for the style of this watch only. He complained right away that the watch band was scratching him. After 3 days the minute digit got loose and would not turn anymore. I returned this watch and requested same type but with standard watch band.

Good readable watch for my 6 year old grandson. He discovered that the minute numbers on the outside blue edge can be rotated around which makes time reading incorrect and hopefully it won't fall off in the future. Velcro strap works fine too.  Only thing I'd recommend to the company is make the hour hand a bit darker to contrast with the white background.,Many children take years to learn how to tell time so start early teaching them!,4.0,B005PKYT4S
Great idea since it has all the necessary information.. However it would be better if the face were bigger.

"Once our 4 year started showed more of an interest of telling time by looking at his wrist, it was time to get him a watch and teach him instead of it being 11 o'clock all day.

I ordered it for myself during mid  November, so it did take a while to get here since it wasn't on Amazon Prime (I received it during the end of December). It's not too hard to set up, but I do have to press the button every time I want to check the time.  Also, it says it's waterproof, but it says that you can't press the button while in the water, which is a bit weird but I guess it is good if you accidentally wear it in the shower or if you're walking in the rain.  There is one thing that I am a bit worried about... I am not sure how long the battery will last and what I should do when it does run out of battery.  Other than that I found myself an extremely happy customer with a comfortable and fashionable watch.  Some people have actually confused it with an apple watch which I think is funny, but if you want to challenge your brain a little, you would enjoy this product.

My kid already learns how to use the stop watch and the date function. The timer takes a little more work, as the amount of time needs to be specified first.

"My children absolutely love their new watches but I was extremely disappointed to find the watches in the condition in which they were when they arrived. I purchased both watches ""new"" just in time for my children's birthdays. The 1st watch had so much hot glue to hold the arm on that I couldn't dig it out and was completely missing the pin to keep the arm attached. The second watch also had a ton of glue but in this case it was supporting the pin. Unfortunately I didn't have time to return either watch but instead rook them to my jeweler who only charged me $5 to repair both watches. Needless to say I was highly disappointed! Since I have to give at least one star, I will only give one but please note the quality doesn't deserve it.",My children absolutely love their new watches but I was extremely disappointed to ...,1.0,B000A8BU8S

"Bought this watch for my wife, who is a huge Harry Potter Fan.  Thought that she might have seen it before, but turns out that this was the first time she had ever seen it.

The watch comes in a Harry Potter Goblet of Fire tin case that can be later used as a small coin bank.  The watch appears well made all the way around, keeps time correctly, and the emblem cover appears to be made of some sturdy material that has a very positive snap when it closes.

Spoke to several other Harry Potter fans and none of them have seen this watch, appears to be a real winner.  This is turning out to be a must have, especially for its clearance price.

Hope this helps",Great present for the Harry Potter Fan,4.0,B000AXUQJW
"There are many reasons to collect HP watches.  In my case, I wanted to have a watch that would be a sort of souvenir for each Harry Potter movie released.  And what better souvenir watch for the fourth movie installment than one having the image of the three friends and the Goblet on its dial!

The Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Flip Top Watch by SII Marketing International measures 1.25"" in diameter.  This collectible wristwatch was first issued in 2005 and at that time I thought it was a large one.  Now that I have seen the GOF models for this year, I think this flip top watch is sized just right.  The brushed brass tone flip top features an ornate shield with the HP logo at its center.  Two small ruby-like stones (they're probably glass) adorn the top and bottom center of the shield.  The flip top opens to a 90-degree angle to reveal Harry, Ron, Hermione and the Goblet of Fire against a silver patterned background.  The brass case is nicely complemented by a dark brown crocodile style leather band with enough punch holes to fit small wrists.  The words ""Harry Potter"" are engraved on the buckle.

I had a hard time rating this watch because my judgment is based on both the functionality and the aesthetics of the piece.  This watch definitely deserves 4 stars in the looks department but somewhat less when it comes to practicality.  You have to hold the flip top open.  The shiny dot markers are easily seen but the delicate sword-styled hands and sweep seconds hand were designed to blend with the characters' black cloaks and uniforms which makes telling time on this watch a bit hard to do.

Still, this timepiece is a worthy addition to any Harry Potter watch collection.  It's beautiful and it's great for displaying.  And wear it if you like.  You may not be able to tell the time at a glance but the flip top of this watch makes for a cool way to let the world know you're an HP fan.",Beautiful watch to celebrate a great movie,3.0,B000AXUQJW

"My baby girl has beat this thing half to death for over a year now, and it is still ticking away like a Timex is known to do. It also has the numbers for the minutes written on the face (very small, but no problem for my children's eyes) making it a great watch to teach your kids how to tell time. That is exactly what we did with this piece, and she was almost the only kid in her 2nd Grade class that could tell time on a proper watch with hands, let alone use it to read a map and find true North. She was the envy of all of her friends. In my opinion, teaching them on a useful watch along with how to find north and use it on a map was much more engaging, fun, and all around informative for my kids.

She is now in 4th grade, and still uses this watch all the time. It is quite dirty looking now, but works perfectly and is still easy to read as the day she got it. I will probably replace it with the same one with a different band soon. If anyone ever mentions which way we're going, she always checks her watch against the sun to tell them... Even though she's done it so much now she pretty much ALWAYS know EXACTLY where North is! LOL. Great buy.","Still ticking after a year, great buy",4.0,B000AYW0IG
"My 8 year old had the basics of telling time down but was not confident at all. With the minutes listed by fives above the 1, 2, 3 ect. she has become proficient and confident at telling time right down the the minute.

It was a bit stiff the first couple of days since my daughter's wrist was smaller than where the bend was originally formed by the velcro but it loosened up quickly.  It also lights up to the delight of young children.  Definitely the best ""first"" watch I have purchased and I have bought many others.",Great Watch!,5.0,B000AYW0IG

"I purchased this item for my daughter as a Christmas gift, she has a very small wrist so I figured a girls watch would be the perfect fit. When the item arrived I noticed it did not work, upon reading the instructions I figured out that there was supposed to be a plastic tab under the crown to keep the crown pulled out so the battery did not run down. There was no plastic tab and the crown was pushed in, dead battery! I called the manufacturer and asked what to do, they told me I could send it to them but it would take 4-6 weeks to replace the battery and if I had it replaced locally it would viod the 5 year warranty. I asked to speak to another rep as I was not pleased, they did not pack it properly according to their own instructions, if they had put the tab in the crown in the first place the battery would not be dead. My thinking is that no one wants to send in a watch and wait 4-6 weeks for a return, not to mention that their manual also states that the battery life is only 2 years meaning that at some point in the 5 year warranty period you will have to send the watch in to them..and wait 4-6 weeks for them to replace the battery. These people at Activa could learn a thing or two about service from the Amazon reps, even the AMazon guy said that was insane.

"I bought this Lego Bionicle Rakshi watch as a gift for my nephew's birthday.  If you have never played with Lego toys and don't know a thing about Bionicles, you're in for a challenge.  For starters, the instructions are minimal.  Also, there's no picture on how the finished product should look like to guide you. My nephew and I spent some time figuring out what that black ball piece was for and where that red strange piece should go. It was fun but also a bit frustrating.  In the end, it took two grown-ups to solve the mystery on how to put the Bionicle head together and how to mount it on the watch.  But what a sense of accomplishment we all got at the end!  And the watch is pretty cool with its Bionicle head.  You can rotate it to the side or move it up and down. I also like the color scheme of gray, orange and black. The links fit tightly so the strap won't come apart easily.
People who are more familiar with Lego products would probably have put this watch together in a snap, but don't get intimidated if this watch is your very first one.

"I had bought the Armitron Kung Fu Panda watch as a birthday gift for my fiance as she loves the movie and loves watches. So I was excited when I came across this watch on Amazon.

When I received it, it was a beautiful watch, gorgeous leather strap and beautiful face. It's definitely not a kid size watch--size is appropriate for adult male or teenager. I did notice that the hands of the watch were not moving. I was going to return it but then I saw the amazon notice in the box stating that sometimes the watch may not work because it may be a wind up watch or solar, so I figured it was one of those types of watches as I have never had any problems with any amazon orders.

My fiance came to visit me (long distance relationship) for her birthday and she LOVED the watch!!! Problem was we realized that it wasn't a wind up watch or solar and it was past the 30 days when I bought it. I felt embarrased giving her a watch that didn't work, she said it was okay, so we went to get a battery placed in it and it worked for a few hours and then it stopped. Something was wrong with it. I was really disappointed, had I not seen that Amazon notice, I would've returned it right away or at least exchanged it because the watch is beautiful and my fiance loved it. I'd highly suggest next time even if you've always been happy with amazon that if you buy a watch and even if it's a gift (especially) to go ahead and open the box and read through the manual to make sure it's a wind up watch, battery operated or solar, that way if it doesn't work you can return it within the 30 day window and not be embarrased when you give a broken watch as a gift.",Kung Fu Panda Armitron Watch,2.0,B00188216Y

"I'm an adult and have a small wrist.  I have a hard time finding a watch that will fit my small wrist and actually keep water out.  I tried this one because I figured Speedo makes things for swimming and so probably it might actually keep water out (unlike the 4 Timex watches that are in my watch graveyard from the last year).  It actually works!  The functions aren't quite as intuitive as others, but you get used to them.  Since it kind of looks ""jelly"" like, I've gotten actual compliments at work from the 20-somethings since that's apparently ""in"" now.  I swim for exercise a couple of times a week and I can read my watch while I swim.  My favorite feature is how the watch closes.

It keeps accurate time and seems like very high quality as well.

My son is in 3rd grade and he has no problem telling the time; the numbers are easy to see and figure out.  So that's a plus... no vague dots that are confusing at this age. Very well thought out!

This is the third children's Timex watch we have given to various grandchildren and they have all been well received and work perfectly.",First Watch,5.0,B002CVTOQ6
I was looking for a knock about watch and chose this Timex. It is cute and the back light is a bonus. The adjustable stretch band works well. Good value for the money.,Beautiful Watch,5.0,B002CVTOQ6
"We love the Timex kids' watches because they are reliable, and even a five year old can slip it on easily by himself/herself.  My son loves the dinosaurs, and it's wonderful that he wears it because he will look at a digital clock, then at his watch, and he is teaching himself analog time.  Timex makes another watch with a velcro black strap that has Indiglo - my older son prefers that one and he can handle putting on the watch strap himself.  I do wish this watch had Indiglo, but otherwise it is a good, inexpensive, reliable watch.",Good starter watch,5.0,B002CVTOSE
"My kids really love the Timex Kids' Time Teacher watches - we have one with a purple monkey stretch band and one with a blue band with cars and trucks.  We looked around for the longest time before finding these watches - our kids wanted watches, but we really struggled to find simple, inexpensive analog kids' watches (you'd think it would be pretty simple!).

PROS
+ display is very easy to read

+ band has cool and interesting graphics on it that kids want to wear

+ inexpensive watch

+ your kids learn to tell time with a real watch

+ durable watch

+ watch is easy to put on

CONS
- Not all of the watches seem to have a second hand

- Not all of the watches are as legible as others

- No date feature on the watch

All in all, very much recommend the Timex Kids Time Teacher Purple Monkey as well as Timex Kids Time Teacher Blue Cars and Trucks Stretch Band Watches, as well as others of the same basic design from Timex.",Great watch!,5.0,B002CVTOSE

"So, this isn't the most exciting thing to get a 4-year-old, but toys aren't everything people. The light works fine and it's nice quality, but the strap is a bit lame in that there is usually a flap of it dangling when he wears it. It's a soft elastic, so not too much of a bother, but I don't want to cut it and create a possibility of it unraveling.",birthday gift for 4-year-old,3.0,B002CVTOT8
"The watch looks great (size, color, design are awesome) BUT we received a defective one and, under Timex's warranty terms, all shipping costs to get it fixed are at our charge.

"My 3-yr-old son loves this watch. We've had it for about 6 months now and he still wants to wear it all the time. It's very durable and practical. My only complaint is that the watch band tends to slip over time. Basically, the teeth on the buckle are not sharp enough to hold the elastic band in place very long. This could be fixed by getting a different band or finding a difference buckle. You could probably jury-rig something to get it to work better. I just haven't had the time to do it yet myself. Otherwise, this is an outstanding watch with an unbeatable warranty, especially for a children's product.",Excellent kids watch!,4.0,B002CVTOT8
"My son (7) loves this watch. It is very lightweight, and the INDIGLO light is fun.

"If your boy knows how to read a clock, chances are he'll like this Indiglo watch from Timex.  It keeps accurate time. The face and numerals are clear and it lights up in the dark (like in a movie theater) when you push the button.

"This watch is fun, and everyone compliments my son when he wears it, the problem is that the band pinches his arm.  It is that cheaper type of material that they make kids watches with.  It seems to work well, and it hasn't broken yet.  It does have a metal closure, that seems to be where the pinching comes from.  I remember having something similar when I was a kid.  I definitely paid too much for this.  I wish it had a cloth/velcro band.

"Pros: It is pink, it has princesses, its Disney, and I can afford it
Cons: Super small digital display, no illumination, and It only suits my daughter's tastes and wardrobe.

My daughter loves the princesses and the pink that the watch obviously offers. However, the digital time is so tiny that when she asks me if it is one-one-one-five (11:15am), I have to hold her wrist close enough so i can read the equivalent of Times New Roman font size 8 on a printed report. As we are trying to teach her how to read the time, this makes it very difficult to verify that she is correct (luckily she is most of the time... yeah my honor student is way smarter than your cat and dog *bumper sticker it*). In summary, if you are trying to teach your kid how to read the time on a digital watch ,this one makes my eyes and my back hurt.

Even though she loves it, when it arrived the band was wavy (and still is) from the way it was packaged, and doesn't lay flat on her wrist.

"So bought it in 3 different colors, but when it arrived two of the watches didn't work (I'm assuming the batteries were dead), and the one I gave my son (the Firefly one) for Christmas, lasted 3 days and then that battery ran out. I know these watches are fun and stay on the wrist well, especially for younger children (it fit perfectly for my son who is 10 and average size), was a tiny bit big for my daughter who is 8, but the silicon grip still worked well, and quite big for my 6-yr old (who is a skinny wee thing), and I specifically got it because the time is easy to read, the silicon grip helps the watch to stay on the wrist, and younger children don't have to fiddle around with straps and buckles, and they are waterproof which is awesome, so if they get wet, or the kids want to swim with them it is no big deal.

Excellent for teaching the young Mini fans how to tell time,Five Stars,5.0,B005OVCBX4
"This watch is a great idea.  My daughter just turned 6yrs, and she quickly learned how to tell the time with this watch.  I like how the hands say ""hours"" and ""minutes"" and the watch is stamped with hours (""1"", ""2"", ""3""...) as well as the minutes (""10"", ""15"", ""20""...), and not with a rotating bezel that has minute stamped on it like some watches (which would confuse kids in getting started).  That's why I got this one for my daughter.

However, the watch started to show its poor quality within 2 months.  Namely, the minute hand was slightly bent out of box, and kept on clipping the minute hand (& not being able to move over it), so the watch practically stops.  Next, that the minute hand came completely loose (just dangling & free-rotating around), so the watch can't be read correctly.

"I purchased this watch for a couple of reasons.  One of the expectations was met, the other was not.  The face of this watch is FANTASTIC!  It is the perfect tool for teaching children how to tell time.  The other reason I chose this watch was for the soft fabric band that closed with velcro.  I assumed that since my daughter's wrist is so slender this would be the best option.  The velcro is so thick that it is cumbersome to work with.  It basically cannot be adjusted without causing a huge bulge, thus leading to discomfort on the wearer.  I already spent more than I wanted (in comparison to all the other teaching watches out there) on this watch, and now I have to take it to a jeweler/watch repair place to have them put a new band on it.  So this watch is going to end up costing me close to $50.  Which is just utterly ridiculous!",so-so,2.0,B005OVCKZ8

However that being said the numbers are so small and the hands are so narrow that its difficult to even see the hands and you can forget about even trying to read what they say! In all 3 of our families opinion if you're buying this to teach your child to tell time it would be best to chose a different watch!  Its a great idea but they should have spent a bit more money constructing it so it could do it's job. So disappointed - we had such hope!!!",Not what we expected!,1.0,B005OVF37K

I bought this for my granddaughter and the only thing about it that I am not really happy with is the hour hand.  It is a white hand on a very light background and is difficult to see.  It would have been much better had it been a darker color.  Still the minute numbers are very easy to read without being bulky.  It will be a Christmas gift so I don't know how well the battery will hold up but it is easy enough to get changed at a jeweler.  I will probably get her another band after she has worn it a bit as the band looks clumpy.  As far as a teaching watch it is perfect except for the hour hand but it is the best I have found to date.  I think it is overpriced but what isn't?,Almost perfect teaching watch,4.0,B005OVEI8K
"Bought this watch to reward a young learner for excelling in telling time. Watch was supposedly licensed by Disney, but with no standards implied. The bezel clicks as expected at times, and then sticks at times almost as if it will break from poor cutting/assembly. The batter died on 1 of the two watches bought, after only 1 day of use, despite the winding arm being disengaged to stop time functioning. The band itself was poorly cut and beginning to fray in places, and the velcro to secure the band to the watch as well as the wrist was exposed to the skin.
At the end of the day, I did still like the watch, the intended design and idea is wonderful. But the poor quality of ewatchfactory items and the ridiculous prices for what you get will lead me elsewhere next time. The recipient also liked the styling of the watch itself, but the band itched and irritated them each time they put it on until they finally gave up the fight after about 3 days. For $12-15 I'd probably buy another band and suck up the loss when the quality of the watch gives in, but for the listed price of $30, I already feel like a sucker.
For anyone facing the DOA issue as I did with the battery. These cases require a watch case press to get the backs on again, unless you have a rubber coated pliers and a lot of luck not cracking the crystal.","Nice idea, but a Novelty item.",2.0,B005OVEI8K

Third - the battery died within a month. And lastly, the watch band looked dirty and old much too soon. My daughter did not even wear the watch every day, and was not extraordinarily rough with it.

"I got this for my soon to be 5 year olds birthday. However, I couldn't wait and gave it to her when it came in. She loved it!

I read the reviews before buying and saw that some questioned it being called a learning watch. My daughter doesn't know how to read a clock at the moment, so my thoughts are coming from that point of view. That being said, I don't see a problem with using this as a time teaching tool. I think it would be hard to make the numbers big but the actual watch still small enough for a young persons arm. Personally I think it is great. It also comes with a teaching clock built into the cardboard it's attached to. I used that instead of trying to point at the numbers on her watch, which was a big help. This would also pair well with other time teaching tools like a large classroom clock or worksheets, but I think having the watch is a great incentive to keep learning so she can use it.

I also read complaints, although few, on the velcro strap. I think it's a little stiff at the moment, but it seems like it would work itself in the more she wears it. If this does not happen, I'll adjust my review later.  My daughter is 43lbs and at almost 5 wears 5T perfectly. Maybe this will help other parents decide if it will fit their daughter.

The actual watch seems well made and came in a nice case for gift giving.

This watch is not what it shows in pic I bought this watch for my daughter for Christmas online it looked cute she loves tangled. but this is suppose to have hour and seconds showing to help young ones tell time but in reality this watch just is very hard to see both the outer numbers and inner numbers are the same both hour no seconds as shown. Rapunzel is also very hard to see the only nice thing about this watch is the band otherwise its junk. I was very happy with amazons delivery very prompt even at Christmas time that is the only reason I would give 1 star.

"This is the second watch ,first one arrived in a non working condition. This was on Xmas morning, told my grandson that I would get an other one. Three days later the new watch arrived and guess what it did not work either, so I said to my wife, it's unlikely that both are defective. I took it on myself to remove the four screws from the back then the strap pins had to be removed, not an easy task, remove the battery drive to the nearest radio shack find the battery go home install it and reattach the cursed strap. Then it worked $6 .00 later and major disappointment and aggravation . Stay away from this model one can do better at the Walmarts of this world.
